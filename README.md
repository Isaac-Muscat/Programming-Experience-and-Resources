# Programming-Experience-and-Resources
This repository is an archive of my programs, external resources, and tutorials which I have found useful and fascinating. The projects found in this repository include small arcade games, machine learning projects, interesting visual animations, and miscellaneous python scripts.

# Disclaimer
The organization, style, and overall quality of this repository is fairly low as it is a composition of the projects I worked on as a beginner while learning various coding concepts.
