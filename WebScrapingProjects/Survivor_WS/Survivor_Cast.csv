Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title!

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways!

Adam Klein,"Hometown:Burlingame| CaliforniaCurrent residence: Los AngelesPrevious season:Winner ofSurvivor: Millennials vs. Gen X(Season 33)Occupation:Keynote speaker and hostHobbies:Board games| poker| travel| and if I am being honest|Survivor.Pet peeves:When you ask someone to take a picture and they take dozens of the exact same photo.Three words to describe you:Personable| determined and caring.When did you first watchSurvivor?Season finale of Season 1. Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",8,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",10,0

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways! In the ""pinball machine"" of life| one thing can change everything about a person's life. Survivor was that one thing.

What happened next literally changed the trajectory of my life. This show has brought happiness and memories to so many people around the world| and it's cool to be a small part of that.How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?The last time I played this game was in 2004 onSurvivor: All Stars... there were no Idols| hidden clues| advantages| or ways to get back into the game. And get this—we actually had to survive! The game has changed and so have I. I plan to adapt| have fun and push my mind| body| and spirit to the max.",10,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch.

It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends.

I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy.

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy.

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways!

Adam Klein,"Hometown:Burlingame| CaliforniaCurrent residence: Los AngelesPrevious season:Winner ofSurvivor: Millennials vs. Gen X(Season 33)Occupation:Keynote speaker and hostHobbies:Board games| poker| travel| and if I am being honest|Survivor.Pet peeves:When you ask someone to take a picture and they take dozens of the exact same photo.Three words to describe you:Personable| determined and caring.When did you first watchSurvivor?Season finale of Season 1. Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",14,0

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways! In the ""pinball machine"" of life| one thing can change everything about a person's life. Survivor was that one thing.

Adam Klein,"Hometown:Burlingame| CaliforniaCurrent residence: Los AngelesPrevious season:Winner ofSurvivor: Millennials vs. Gen X(Season 33)Occupation:Keynote speaker and hostHobbies:Board games| poker| travel| and if I am being honest|Survivor.Pet peeves:When you ask someone to take a picture and they take dozens of the exact same photo.Three words to describe you:Personable| determined and caring.When did you first watchSurvivor?Season finale of Season 1. Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",15,0

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways! In the ""pinball machine"" of life| one thing can change everything about a person's life. Survivor was that one thing.

This show has brought happiness and memories to so many people around the world| and it's cool to be a small part of that.How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?The last time I played this game was in 2004 onSurvivor: All Stars... there were no Idols| hidden clues| advantages| or ways to get back into the game.

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",21,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch.

It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",22,0

What happened next literally changed the trajectory of my life.

I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy.

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy.

Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",24,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title!

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",26,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title!

So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",27,0

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time.

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy.

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends.

I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time.

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy.

Neal Gottlieb,Name (Age): Neal Gottlieb (38)Tribe Designation: BrainsCurrent Residence: Sausalito| Calif.Occupation: Ice Cream EntrepreneurPersonal Claim to Fame: I started Three Twins Ice Cream with my life’s savings of $70|000 in 2005 at age 28 after returning from the Peace Corps. I couldn't afford employees| so I did everything myself at first. I opened another shop| then another and then built a factory in 2010 to start selling pints to grocery stores| and have since opened a second factory. We're now sold in grocery stores in all 50 states| have a team of around 100 and sales this year that will be about 100 times sales from the first year| despite almost going broke during the economic downturn and unrelenting competition. I am proud of the growth| taking on the challenges| being creative| treating employees well| giving a great deal back and inspiring others through my version of the American dream.Inspiration in Life: I am not much for heroes| but the person who has come closest to obtaining hero status is my Uncle Larry.

I admire him for his larger-than-life deeds| like finding 55 pounds of cocaine off the coast of Florida (he’s a former cop and turned it in).

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy.

It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy.

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",33,0

My dream is to winSurvivorand I'm going to make it happen!Personal claim to fame:As a volunteer| I chaired a Relay For Life event that raised over $135|000 for cancer research and grew in size from about 10 youth participants to over 500. If any of that money helps save my mom's life| then it is| by far| my most important accomplishment.Inspiration in life:My mom.

She can tear up the dance floor—that's where I get my moves!—and she's my best friend and supporter.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?A picture of my family to keep myself grounded and focused| a fake hidden Immunity Idol because the threat can be just as powerful as the real thing| and a razor because I hate mustaches with a fiery passion.Survivorcontestant you're most like:Spencer Bledsoe(Cagayan|Cambodia).

I hate it. I would do away with all gum on earth if I could.What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer?To me| it means that you work hard. It means you get up with a purpose and a goal each day. It means that you can do anything in America as long as you work hard and never give up.Personal claim to fame:I came from nothing. I came from a trailer with no running water left behind by a drug-trafficking father at 15. I overcame tremendous odds. I put myself through college on a football scholarship. I put myself through law school. I did this on my own and have earned the respect of an entire community.For years| my hometown of Sulphur| Oklahoma| had a sign that said: ""The Home of Chris Hammons."" The sign is actually in my garage now.Inspiration in life:Gerry Spence because he’s the America's greatest trial lawyer that ever lived. He has fought for American rights longer than I’ve been alive. He gives me inspiration to continue that great fight so the accused| the oppressed| the injured| the “little guy” will have a voice in America.When we| trial lawyers| quit fighting| Americans will have no voice. He is a true patriot and the most loving man I have ever met. Without his program and path| I might have been lost the rest of my life.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?A medicine pouch given to me by an Indian Chief and blessed with love and caring| which would give me power in challenges; a journal and pencil to document my adventure but| more than that| write down all the details of each member so I could memorize their stories better; and a picture of my boys. I would use the pain of not seeing them as motivation.

Life seems to get in the way of adventures. I love competition and I just seeSurvivoras the ultimate game and the ultimate competition.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I have always been able to juggle people and their different personalities.

I came from a generation of fighters. The foundation of my family was built on strong women. Yes| my great grandparents| grandparents| and parents were married but| unfortunately| they didn't stay married. During that time| raising children as a single parent was be extremely hard| but the strength the women of my family showed—their will to never give up| their triumph over sweat and tears—shaped me into the woman I am today.We are strong and most of the women I grew up with also demonstrate that same strength and willpower. Nothing was handed to us. We worked hard and| if we failed| we tried again. That's the overall mindset of a Gen-Xer. Never let your failures keep you down. You only stay a failure if you don't get back up and try again.Personal claim to fame:Overcoming adversity and striving to be the best mother I can be to my children by supporting and pushing them to achieve their goals and dreams while| at the same time| still pushing to achieve my own goals and dreams.Inspiration in life:My grandmother| Eleanor| because she's a lover| a giver| and she always gives her very last to help anyone| especially her family. Her home is always open and she’s always spreading love through her cooking. If you’re hungry| you can always sit down and enjoy a meal at my grandmother’s house.

Why does no one eat breakfast anymore?!Personal claim to fame:Playing chess against Magnus Carlsen| the No. 1 ranked player in the world.Inspiration in life:Mr. Spock [fromStar Trek]. He's highly intelligent| logical| and has trouble fitting in. If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why? Beads| string| and polished stones to make fake Immunity Idols for other people to find.Survivorcontestant you're most like:I relate most to the guys who don't fit in such asJohn Cochran(South Pacific|Caramoan)—he's my intellectual equal with slightly larger muscles.

Because of my small size and lack of physical stature| people won't perceive me as a threat.I also have the most importantSurvivortrait one can have: paranoia. My eyes and ears will be at full attention| searching for any hint of a vote going bad for me.

Just look at that old-timey compass.Survivorcontestant you're most like:I'm a bigJohn Cochran(South Pacific|Caramoan) fan. He used his humor and fish out of water-ness to control the game without seeming threatening. Cochran had a buff collection and wrote a paper onSurvivorat Harvard Law School.

Leaving all that you know for a city of unfamiliarity? Scary. That's why I'm ready for a bigger challenge. Survivor is the ultimate challenge.Inspiration in life:My mother. She did everything she could to make life for us okay| having gone through a very toxic relationship with our father. She showed me courage and strength in standing up for herself and showing us what we are worth. I admire her for that.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?I'd bring a razor| a pair of water shoes—I'd rather not step on sea urchins| but if I must| I must—and a blanket.

There were no vacations| days off| or breaks. No matter the weather| their health| or lack of money| they never gave up. They never stopped.That lesson has never left me. No one will live my life for me. No one is going to give me a break. If I want something| I have to get up and do it| regardless of how I may feel or how hard it may be. My life was decided by no one but myself. I saw the struggle my parents endured and I made a promise to myself to never stop trying to achieve any goal I set out to achieve. Nothing I have was handed to me. I had to earn it and I continue to do so every day.Personal claim to fame:Getting into law school| making it through| passing the bar and excelling as a prosecutor. I did all of this while also getting married and starting a family. Within a six-year time span| I was married| graduated undergrad| started law school| had my first child| passed the bar| was hired as a prosecutor| and had my second child.I recently had a trial in which the jury gave me a round of applause when it was completed. The presiding judge later told me he had never seen a prosecutor get a round of applause—and he has been on the bench for over 20 years. That moment was confirmation that the lack of sleep| long hours| hard work| and mental strain were all truly worth enduring.Inspiration in life:My dad. He was born to be a farm hand and his upbringing was extremely difficult. He is truly dedicated to his family and has a spirit and will that’s indescribable.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?Lip balm because it travels everywhere with me. Champagne and salt and vinegar chips| which I am lumping into one item because they always go together. Pictures of my family for inspiration and a reminder of what truly matters.Survivorcontestant you're most like:Cirie Fields(Panama|Micronesia|Heroes vs. Villains). Her early life struggles are very similar to my own. This caused both of us to develop a resilient personality| the ability to push ourselves| and never give up. This| along with our strong desire to help our families| gave us what many people lack—drive.Reason for being onSurvivor:My life is like that set of stairs in the movieLabyrinth: the directions don't make sense nor does the order| but I always manage to find my way through and get where I want to go. For me| those stairs never stop. My motivation comes from within and I will never be done or satisfied.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?My job requires me to be a great storyteller and I have the burden to prove my case to a jury| which I welcome every time. That burden comes with a significant amount of responsibility and pressure.

I say this because we are born in a time when anything is truly possible; social media and all these different outlets help you to not only learn information quickly| but gives you the capability to become or create anything.

Through everything—including past divorces and serious health issues—she still pushes forward like the little Peruvian soldier she is. She’s had 10 brain aneurisms and received surgical care for six of them. She wakes up every day smiling and not only motivates and inspires me| but everyone she comes in contact with. I am truly blessed.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?iPod because I'm always dancing or jamming out to something; a skimboard just in case there are some waves to ride; and a DVD player with DVDs| so I can lie back and relax after my hard day of living life like a caveman.Survivorcontestant you're most like:I have to sayRussell Hantz(Samoa|Heroes vs. Villains|Redemption Island) andWoo Hwang(Cagayan|Cambodia).

Did I mention I'll be doing this with a smile on my face that will have to make them vote for me in the end?Reason for being onSurvivor:Sometimes I take the things for granted and I would like to strip myself of all the comforts. I want to go out there and play this game and win. I want to be with nature again and I want to lose myself| so I can rediscover myself. The other reason is simple; it's a million dollars. Come on.

My parents both worked so my siblings and I had a lot more responsibilities and were expected to fend for ourselves. We were extremely obedient because we knew our parents worked very hard and we did not want to disappoint them.Trophies were earned—not given—just for participating in sports.

It means that my journey is only a failure if I stop moving forward.Personal claim to fame:Paying off my student loan debt is the crowning achievement of my twenties thus far. As a low-income student at a pricey suburban university| I worked two to three jobs during the majority of my college career| had very little fun| and made every decision based on money.When I graduated and began working as an admission counselor| I kept my expenses low by eating PB&J for lunch| denying myself cable and internet| sticking to my flip phone| and driving my 1992 Honda Accord.

Catty women who make the snide comments| back-handed compliments| and make other girls in the room feel like they don't measure up. Plus| people who are late drive me nuts.What does it mean to be a Gen-Xer?For myself| being a Gen-Xer means being driven and hard working. We don't expect things to be handed to us; we set goals and work hard for what we want in life. We also don't think we deserve to win in every situation and actually look at failure as an opportunity to learn. On the other hand| Gen- Xers can be stuck in our ways and leery of new ideas.

Furthermore| people fascinate me. I can get along with anyone because I tend to be more curious than judgmental of an individual's quirks than judgmental.

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",34,0

This time| I'll be folding the paper up| eating it for fiber| and taking a new parchment if I change my mind.- My infection.- Two closest allies being medically evacuated.- Being forced to make fire to save myself.I managed some tough personalities and assembled a ragtag group to vote out Scot| which felt like dismantling a bomb| making sure all the wires were where they needed to be.Overall| I may have bumped into more obstacles than a ball in a pinball machine| but I played proactively. I owned my actions and fate| and I did it in a way that was true to me.What| if anything| do you most regret?I wish I could take back every second of every one of the five days I lived with Nick. Oh| and I regret letting Joe eat all the red meat.How would you play differently this time?Going intoGame Changers| I know I’ll have a target on my back| especially since other players will have just seen my season. I can’t play under the radar… people won’t buy it. I plan to align with a variety of people| including power players and villains to pad myself.In Survivor 34| I will:1. Do with certainty and apologize later.2. Be friendly with more people and have intense relationships with less.3. Execute with finesse.,34,0
Michaela Bradshaw,"Age: 25Hometown: Fort Worth| TXPreviously played on:Season 33:Millennials Vs. Gen X| Finished 14thHow have you changed since the last time you played?SinceMillennials Vs. Gen X| I've found it a lot easier to take action in the face of fear. After surviving loneliness| starvation| physical exhaustion| and exposure to the elements| I just can't allow silly things like “what-if"" scenarios to have control over me.Also| I find that my reaction is to laugh at ridiculous things as opposed to becoming upset or angry. Whether it’s an annoying person| an unexpected delay| or a letdown of some sort| I just don't have the energy to be upset at anything that can't win me $1 million.What skills do you bring toSurvivorthat will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?I bring intelligence and realness to this game. In a game filled with paranoid people who thrive on deception| those qualities are a breath of fresh air to some.SinceMillennials Vs. Gen X| I've been learning how to hide what I'm thinking and what I'm capable of to some degree. I found out first hand that in a game for $1 million| no one wants to play with someone they think they can't beat.What are you most proud of from the last time?I'm most proud of the fact that I broke a lot of stereotypes. I was the woman who carried my tribe. I was the black girl who could swim and wasn't afraid to get her hair wet. I was the emotional one who could still make a logical decision. I was the ""athlete"" who was actually intelligent and articulate. I didn't fit in a box| and I liked that about myself.What| if anything| do you most regret?I regret not understanding the importance of perception. What's real doesn't matter in this game. What people think and how they feel is what matters. My mistake inMillennials Vs. Gen Xwas not paying close enough attention to how others felt.How will you play differently this time?I will play differently by monitoring how I am perceived. Instead of bucking the system| I'm going to ""play the game.""",34,0

Honestly| I would not put my name on anything I did in the last game.What| if anything| do you most regret?EVERYTHING.

And| I also think of myself as a great motivator with the people I'm around. I like taking the leader role in a low-key way.I’ve lived my life as an adventure and I’m extremely in touch with nature.

I knew it would be hard to win| so I let myself climb down. If I hadn’t climbed down| I could have held onto the pole for a lot longer.I let myself take the easy way out| which is hardly ever the best decision.

I am proud that I broke away from their alliance to have a voice and played my own game. Deciding on my own destiny resulted in making the Final 3.And| yes| I am so happy to have saved Mark| the chicken. I worked really hard foraging for food so others didn't eat him.I am also proud to bring awareness to how we humans need to take care of our environment and have compassion for other living things.What| if anything| do you most regret?I regret not managing the Jury better and not being able to articulate| own| and defend all that I accomplished during the game. I regret spending so much time and energy providing for camp which took me away from the game play.Toward the end| I was completely depleted which affected how I played and performed at the final Tribal.How will you play differently this time?I am much more confident about the game now. I know I have a lot to offer and I can get along with everyone; now it's time to create strong relationships. It's good to have friends in both an alliance and on the Jury. I will be much more observant and aware of my position within the rest of the tribe.I need to be more flexible and fluid in this ever-changing game of strategy| focusing on the bigger picture of winning the game rather than personal friendships.

I want strong relationships when this is over| but already have a host of great friends.I make mistakes| but I'm a good person with a good heart. I hope America sees that. But if my competition doesn't| their loss.What are you most proud of from the last time?Being chosen by America| by far! Also| my instinctual gameplay. My ability to control a volatile group of people and be the determining factor as to who went home on the first two boots.What| if anything| do you most regret?Going too hard| too soon. Playing with too much emotion in the beginning. Drawing the Angkor buff. No matter how good of a game you're playing| drawing the wrong buff can change everything.How will you play differently this time?I want to have more fun this time. I’ll combine my Outback and Cambodia styles—hard gameplay with a more subtle approach. I plan to try and control my emotions more.

Instead| they will make me a very threatening member.I haven't learned any new skills since I played on Cagayan| which could be my downfall going back on an all returnee season. I wish I could have learned the skill of being able to be quiet and try to play under the radar| but I don't see that happening. It’s just not in my DNA.What are you most proud of from the last time?WINNING!!What| if anything| do you most regret?There is seriously nothing I regret. Everything I did on Cagayan was on the fly.

When it comes to voting someone out at Tribal| I want to keep in mind just one thing: any name but mine will do just fine.What are you most proud of from the last time?For all its strange alchemy and upheavals of emotion| energy| and stomach| I enjoyed it all with exuberance and an ability to laugh and forgive myself and others.What| if anything| do you most regret?Not making more of an effort to reach out to Scot and Jason. Everyone and anyone can be an ally| if only for one vote.How will you play differently this time?Attempt to reach out to as many people as possible while still maintaining sincerity and decency. I know we are just playing a game| but attachments happen| and feelings really do get bruised.If I'm going to lie| I hope not to be too much of a wanker about it. Keep the lines of communication open to all and try not to let slights| injustices| real or imagined| get to me.Perhaps gain 10 lbs| as well; foraging for food often uses more energy than we got from finally eating it.Survivoris EXHAUSTING| mentally and physically| I'd like to keep a mental picture of many rescued animals| safe and happy| to remind me of why I'm playing again.,34,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy.

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",36,0

Before her birth I was very overweight| smoked cigarettes| dabbled quite a bit at the craps table and would most likely be sitting down at the poker table on any given day. I recall a specific moment when my daughter was about a year old and she wanted me to take her outside on the swings. It was chilly that day so I had to dress warm. While putting on my shoes| I recall panting from being out of breath from the simple act of tying my own shoes.It was at that moment that I knew I had to make a change so that I would be around a long time for her and my other children that were soon to come. In the last seven years| I quit smoking| dropped 65 pounds and even though I can still occasionally be found in a poker room| I have dramatically prioritized where my income goes and where most of my money is spent| which is primarily bills and workout clothes for my wife.Who or what is your inspiration in life?My father. He raised nine kids on a construction salary| taught his boys to be men and his daughters to be ladies.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?A photo of my wife| a picture of my rugrats because they're awesome| and an antihistamine| which I will spike in somebody's drinking water if they are relentlessly annoying me and/or the group on the island.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I know you are looking for one| but I am going to split this in three. Mostly Cirie| because I think she is masterfully empathetic with other players. She has an amazing ability to disable people. I hope I can do what she has done in the game. Second is Cochran. He wins in the emotional intelligence category that allows him to morph into whatever he needs to at the time. He also understands the importance of stroking other people's egos when he needs to. This is something I hope I am capable of doing. And finally Rob Mariano| for the simple fact that we both come from Italian families with a background in construction. But more importantly| he sees the game big picture which is critical and I hope I can maintain.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?Obviously this is the opportunity of a lifetime to play this game| but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take a forced break from real life. And I don't mean that I am happy to leave my family or my job| but this game will force me to be away from my life for a set period of time which I hope will open my eyes to what's important when I get home. Oh yeah| and that money is mine!Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I grew up in a house with eight siblings. Lack of food| clothes| and showers are something I'm accustomed to.

Freshman year when school ended| I didn't have anywhere to go. My parents were in Nigeria and both my brothers were in the U.S. but not much older than me so they couldn't help. This resulted in me being homeless for 1-2 months.Who or what is your inspiration in life?Beyoncé. She works so hard and is constantly topping herself. She literally sets the standard for every performer and artist and continues to raise the bar. She had Adele and Kanye West on stage defending her when she didn't win an award. Who else can do that? She is one of the few super humans to walk the Earth.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?A picture of a skeleton in a grave to constantly remind me that things could be worse| a photo book of my family because I will always love them and they forever motivate me and finally| text message threads between me and my best friend. We have the funniest conversations and laughing is the best way to stay positive and happy.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?Michaela! I am a strong black woman who is not afraid to make power moves. I haven't had an easy life and sure as hell don't expect winningSurvivorto come easy. I relate a lot to her because we are both strong-willed and determined and willing to do what it takes to accomplish our goals.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?The million dollars would change my life drastically. I would have a story for the books—the girl that went from village to Versailles. I've seen it all| from the slums to the fast-paced| hard working student life in NYC. I want to change my life and my surroundings.

My dad is one of the hardest working people I know. My mom tutors incarcerated women| volunteers on Election Day| and contributes to our local community in a loving| selfless way.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?A bag of Skittles. I'm addicted to candy and just one Skittle a day would keep me going through starvation! Next| a deck of cards so I could get people to play games that require deceit| and try to read tells| and tampons| because| duh.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I hope I'm a mix between Kelley Wentworth and Aubry Bracco. Kelley is a badass game player who would do anything to win. She gets people to trust her and is still a snake. I'm also a little bit Aubry—strategic| very intuitive| but slightly neurotic and quirky.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?As Probst says|Survivoris a human experiment.

I want to prove to myself that I can take on this insane physical and mental challenge.Survivoris the greatest game on earth| and I'd like to try my hand at it.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I will survive because of my innate ability to make people feel comfortable.

Laugh| dammit!Three words to describe you:Self-deprecating| charming| and affable—though others would say ""punchable.""What's your personal claim to fame?Nothing feels better than hearing your own music for the millionth time and still enjoying it. And even better| when other people hear your music for the first time and it makes them cry. You can't fake those kinds of responses. It's the best. Cheesy? Maybe. True? You bet| man.Who or what is your inspiration in life?I have a few but I suppose Robin Williams is the most well-known one. When I was a little kid| Genie fromAladdinwas my entire sense of humor. That wild| a-hundred-jokes-a-minute pacing| all the voices and wackiness completely dazzled me. As I got older| I got to appreciate all his other amazing roles and unabashedly nutty stand-up routines. I'm often told I'm too loud. I blame that entirely on Robin Williams.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?First would be my guitar because it gives me something I can focus on outside of the game. Next| one of those daily joke calendars because not only is it great for keeping track of time| but if your situation isn't providing many laughs| it's good to have a reliable way to find some. Finally| beard oil. I bought my first vile of this stuff about a year ago and it's the best feeling thing ever. Plus| it's really fun to respond to ""Are you wearing cologne?"" with ""No| just beard oil.""WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I've always felt like I related most to Stephen Fishbach| though I see a lot of David Wright in me as well. I'm a funny| nerdy| neurotic Jewish guy trying to make it in the entertainment business. I'm logical and smart (I like to think)| but I've spent plenty of time crying in private.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?I've been dreaming of doing this for well over a decade. At this point| above all else| it's to prove I can do what I've been saying I could do since I was a kid: WinSurvivor. Part pride| part sticking it to the kids who tortured me growing up. It's a ""What have you accomplished?"" kind of thing. I promise I'm not usually so vengeful!Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?This sounds stupid| but I'm really easy to talk to. I want to set up my situation so everyone knows they can come to me to chat and get support despite any problems they're having personally or socially in the game. I'm a teddy bear| y'know? On top of that| I'm not a weakling. I can haul firewood and follow instructions when it comes to building shelters. I know how to make fire and untie knots and all that.",36,0

I am grateful for the woman she is and instilling in me the fighter I've become. She recently overcame skin cancer with a smile on her face. She's had to work hard and reconstruct her life after some health issues and losing close family members. She is a genuinely kind| graceful woman with fire in her heart. She works with handicapped children which has been a dream of hers. She reminds me I have a bigger purpose in life.I've always really appreciated her strong support in my way of thinking and encouraged me to keep being an extraordinary human being. In other words| having a strong personality and being weird is cool in her book. That normal is boring and with that| normal woman rarely go down in history. To always do everything in life wholeheartedly. It's an ""all or nothing"" kind of life in my mom's eyes. I couldn't agree more with that woman.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?A small plush panda teddy bear my mom gave me. It's special because she calls it my guardian angel. It really is the little things in life. A small bottle of my dad's cologne. He is the one who always pushes me to do better than the best| to be tougher. Being able to smell his cologne will feel like he is right next to me talking words of wisdom and encouragement. I was always a daddy's girl| and most importantly I have this bracelet that says ""ONE MILLION WIN"" (cause Sole Survivor would be a bit too cheesy even for me). It's gold on black strings and it serves as my reminder of how bad I need to win Sole Survivor. I never take it off.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I would play like a combination of people. First would be Tony Vlachos who actually goes out and hunts for idols when no one's paying attention. Next would be to play challenges like challenge beast Kelly Wiglesworth. I'm also going to go for a nice little four win streak. Also| Brenda Lowe who can't help but be expressive| kind but is a total badass in challenges| and finally| Sandra who I can identify with socially in her sassy attitude and manipulative ways.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?One million dollars is a huge motivating factor for me. The bragging right of forever being a legendary Sole Survivor and being 1 of 16 women to win will be nothing short of amazing| but a million dollars is life changing! It would give me the freedom to be able to have a home and not continue to move from crappy apartment to crappy apartment. It would allow me to pursue investing and financial growth which I can turn into my lifelong goal of living a philanthropic life.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?Because of my hell-bent determination and strong will to win. I put my heart into everything I do. I wanted to go to school| so I worked three jobs to pay for it| along with 1|000 hours of internships to graduate. In business I wanted to help my brother and we grew the business from one store to three stores. I know in my heart that I can win. I welcome all challenges with open arms and can read people really well.Socially| it'll be fun to test waters on how diverse I can be in order to really connect with people. After all| I have to cater to people's personalities so they'll feel comfortable doing what I need. Once my heart is set I will stop at nothing until I've achieved my goal even through blood| sweat| and tears. I've studiedSurvivorwell enough to understand how to manipulate the numbers| play idols how they should be played and hustle the social game.

It is D-O-N-A-T-H-A-N| not Jonathan or Donovan.Three words to describe you:Determined| whimsical| and rare.What's your personal claim to fame?I was a part of a national and state level winning dance team. I danced in the hip-hop routine. I am proud of being openly gay and dancing in front of thousands in this area. My goal is always to try to change the opinions of others when it comes to the LGBTQ community and through dancing| I was able to open the arms of many.There will never be another me when it comes to those years and for that impact| I feel very accomplished. Being the only guy to hold a national championship among the basketball| football and baseball guys—yeah| that felt really nice!Who or what is your inspiration in life?My hero is my grandmother| Deloris Bentley. Always has been| always will be. My grandmother had seven children between the years of 1960-1968| with my mom being the youngest. She raised them all with very limited food| no power until 1975| no bathrooms| only outhouses—all while dealing with the day-to-day struggles of having an alcoholic as a husband.Over the years| things got better for her. She raised her children| divorced and re-married (twice)| and ended up being very independent and open-minded! In 2006| she had a brain aneurysm. She flew out to have emergency surgery and you know what saved her that time? Her blood was so thick from smoking three packs a day for so many years| that the aneurysm was sealed shut.After her surgery| she was up the next morning eating on some ice. Now if that isn't inspiring| I don't know what is! She has always been the glue in our family. She is such a hero in my eyes because of all the sacrifices| determination and selflessness she has expressed and shown all her life! Many people are probably picking celebrities and all that jazz| but my little 'ole Maw Maw is my hero.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?My cross necklace my grandmother got for me| my glasses (if that counts) so I can snap them in half to help with making fire| and just the clothes on my back.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?While there are tons of castaways that I have related to| especially those from the LGBTQ community (Colton| Todd| Tia)| and my hillbillies (Keith| Sandy| JT)| I always find the most relatable to be Cirie.No one expected the gameplay Cirie played in her first season. She went out there| hated leaves| and really didn't know much about the game. But you know what? She went out there and learned the way. She kept her mouth shut when need be| made the big moves when she needed to| and had a great sense of the people on the island what they were thinking.She is the type of player I see myself being. I adore her| and it doesn't hurt that her birthday is July 18th and mine July 19th. We Cancers just have a way about us that is charming| yet manipulative. Our knife is always ready for backs (figuratively)!What's your reason for being onSurvivor?It's for me and my family. We have always been below the poverty line. We have always struggled year to year to make ends meet. But it does make you stronger having to live that way. But you know what? I am tired of living this life.I want to be a great influence for my family—prove to them that when you try| things can happen. It takes you to put the first foot in the door| no one else. I don't want to end up being stuck here in a rusted old trailer. I want more for my family| especially my mom and grandmother| and also help those in my area who are less fortunate.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?Living in Eastern Kentucky has its perks. We are outdoors people. We love the lakes| we love to roam trails and mountains| and I have learned a lot about nature and survival. And while I have never been in a dire situation to use these skills| I truly believe when the survivalist in me kicks in| I would have a lot to offer.Now darlin'| I ain't no lumberjack. But I can offer common sense solutions in order to help make my tribe grow.

Backpacking and trekking solo is a massive passion of mine and feeds my wanderlust soul. It is adventurous and crazy at times but it's shaped me more than anything else in life.Who or what is your inspiration in life?Bob Scott. 87 years old. He is my angel. I met him the week of my divorce and two weeks after his wife passed away. I like to think his angel wife brought us together. He taught me to swim shortly after we met because he wanted me to be a ""happy and fit mom"" for my boys. He helped me learn to ride a triathlon bike. He introduced me to the world of triathlon| which changed my world. He competed alongside me at my first half Ironman and full Ironman and still competes to this day. Bob taught me the sport is about fun| fitness| and friends and that to do this for life and be just like him| I had to keep this mentality. We still train together each week as well as compete alongside each other.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?Lipstick!

I never once have stopped believing that this dream would come true. I can have all the strategy in the world and I will! But if I have learned anything from watching the show| participating in endurance events| raising children| working in a fast-paced finance position| studying in an ashram| being an entrepreneur| or all my other adventures is that nothing turns out like you expect. I am really good at adapting to circumstances| to people| and to unlikely situations. Plan A quickly becomes Plan C and it doesn't shake me up. I can endure pain both mental and physical with a smile on my face. Adaptation. A sense of humor. Dreaming big. That embodies who I am and why I will win!",36,0

And finally| a bottle of rum because no self-respecting sailor would be caught on a remote island without rum.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I am passionate| competitive| and neurotic like Spencer.

If you are lazy and also a liar| I won't like you. In fact| it angers me when people act lazy and try to manipulate everyone around them and ruin everything. Now| those pet peeves are going to be alive and well in the land ofSurvivor. Good thing I know how to dish it right back. I have been around people like that my whole life and I know how to deal with it. So yeah| my title of Most Dramatic| in the face of a bunch of liars will be| shall we say... interesting.Three words to describe you:Ambitious| charismatic| and charming.What's your personal claim to fame?My greatest accomplishment was being on a 5th Avenue Versace billboard! It was by no means the end all and be all of where I want to be in life| but it was a major accomplishment. To me it was an accumulation of everything I've worked hard for finally getting justified. It was a huge symbol of perseverance and it was gratifying. I rely on my own self-motivation and have accomplished stuff that was difficult and took legit perseverance| but winningSurvivorwill top all that.Who or what is your inspiration in life?My ma is my hero. But it wasn't always so. Growing up| my mom and I didn't have the best relationship. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) at 27 and had me at 34. God bless her. A lot of side effects of MS don't just affect the body| but the brain as well| such as depression. So as a kid| I couldn't handle or understand what was going on. I look back at my childhood and most memories of my mom and I were difficult. She would have seizures during my baseball games| at my school where she tutored| and the side effects of all the medications made it difficult to have a normal relationship with her.When I was 12| my parents split and the next couple years were even tougher as her disease progressed. If it wasn't for my father telling me I needed to rise above the past and grow up| I would have continued to struggle. When I was told she had two months to live I decided to become a man at 17| and our past struggles brought us even closer. Through the years| our relationship grew| and our love and respect for each other brought our relationship to all-time highs. None of this would be possible if she hadn't beat the odds for almost 10 years now.I will always idolize her perseverance| her grit| and her faith in God. She is the greatest hero anyone can have and I live through her. She never quit or gave in when she was told she had two months to live| so why should I ever quit or give in when life ""gets hard?"" Want to talk about a survivor? That's my mom.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?First would be a good luck necklace my mom gave me when she almost died. I've been wearing it ever since and crazy good things have happened since.

I would provide food like Ken. But unlike Ken| my social game would be on point. I would have Michaela's fire| determination| and athletic ability. I would also be blunt like her| but would do a better job of building relationships. In previous seasons| I would have the social and ladies game like Joe. Joe is eye candy and smooth. I would try and form a coalition with someone like him. He would be my shield and then I would cut him later in the game. As far as Season 36| I won't know whether to play the game like a Florida panther—stealthy and in the shadows| or like a lion—dominating its tribe. I may have to be both| depending on the dynamic of the game.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?The game itself| and to spread the awareness of MS. 2.3 million people worldwide have MS and there is no cure! For me| like life| I've been finding ways to survive for a long time. I want to apply all my experiences with different personalities| and put them to the ultimate test. I want to compete and I want to win. This is a competition of survival. I am a type-A personality and I cannot stand the thought of losing. I have tunnel vision when it comes to winning and there is nothing out there| competition wise| likeSurvivor.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I will bring mySurvivormental toughness| my ability to adapt| my positivity to aid the weak| and my will to survive. I might not know how to do some things| but I will find a way to eat and get water. Whether that's through my creativity| my charm with women| or my ability to make one of the guys my bro. Some men will not like my alpha mentality| which strategically| I will hold back in the beginning as I read people| but I will find my way. They always say ""don't bite the hand that feeds you."" I grew up on an island so if I'm one of the few that can get his own catch and get his own water (which are the two essentials of living)| no one will bite that hand. I will have ultimate power.",36,0

Also| almost everyone I know literally asks me all the time| ""Seb| why are you NOT onSurvivor?"" I just feel like it's my time to shine.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I am perfect for this game. I spend most of my life outside in the elements| a lot of which is involved with something physical. I'm great with people and can make friends very easily.

I was in isolated conditions where life's bare necessities were limited. While deployed to Iraq in 2003-2004| I went months with only taking bottle water showers. The supply lines were compromised so often I was forced to make a decision to either wash with my daily bottled water or consume it. I jumped from several different Military aircrafts and did drown-proofing that consisted of water survival.While deployed to Afghanistan| I was put in situations that required me to influence the local ""elders"" (leaders) of our U.S. missions in their country while at the same time earning their trust. This posed a huge issue because one| I am a female (and their beliefs with females are VERY different than ours) and two| I was an American. However| I was able to gain the trust of the local people as well as many elders.Who or what is your inspiration in life?My son. He has been braver than he believes| stronger than he seems| and smarter than he thinks. I have never met a more amazing person than him.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?First would be my guitar because I have one and played a little in college but it would be a chance for me to have music and learn at the same time.

Finally| an iPod to listen to music.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?Michaela Bradshaw because not only was she fit| outspoken| attractive| and witty| she also spoke her mind and was extremely good at challenges.

I'll do whatever it takes to win| with or without my top.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?To fulfill an exciting and different adventure that a small percent of people get to do.

It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",37,0

A mirror because I'd be scared something would be in my teeth the entire time and no one would tell me.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I relate to Aubry because she is both smart and emotionally intelligent.

Growing up I always admired her for her performance in her season. DuringGuatemala| she showed such determination| drive| and positivity. My goal in life is to stay positive no matter the situation.

Schrute| ""Physician's desk reference. Hollowed out. Inside| waterproof matches| iodine tablets| beet seeds| protein bars and a NASA blanket."" The reason seems obvious here. Also| face wash.

Please let me finish what I have to say| it may be important.Three words to describe you:Determined| athletic| and competitive.What's your personal claim to fame?I am extremely proud of making our S.W.A.T. team. I had to work extremely hard to lose a ton of weight to be physically able to even try out| much less do well enough to make the team. I was one of the youngest and least experienced people to ever make our S.W.A.T. team.Who or what is your inspiration in life?My hero is my stepfather| Tim. Tim met my mother shortly after my parents separated. My whole life he has always been a steady father figure and an amazing role model. He taught me the value of hard work and how to be a humble man. When I met Tim at seven years old| he had nothing. My mother and him worked diligently and started a company from nothing and now want for nothing.Don't get me wrong| they aren't billionaires| but they pretty much do what they want when they want. Tim works many long hours and long nights to provide an amazing life to our family. The best part about him is you will never hear him brag about it.There is a song written by Brad Paisley that makes me think of him and brings tears to my eyes when I hear it. It's called ""He Didn't Have to Be."" It talks about how his stepfather was a great father to him and he hoped that he can be half the dad that he didn't have to be.

I also feel like I can play the game strategically like he did| helping me run deep in the game.I work in a profession that requires me to be able to talk to any type of person through all walks of life and be able to relate and convince them to do things that I may need them to do. Malcolm was such a likeable person that he was voted off because three other contestants knew they wouldn't beat him in the final vote. I feel like I'm a very likeable person. I am able to make friends and relate to people anywhere I go.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?My primary motivation for being on the show is to win. A million dollars would be a great way for me to provide a great life for my children that I wouldn't be able to do otherwise. My secondary motivation is my desire to compete. I love competing and I love winning. I haven't been able to compete at a high level since I played college football and I would love to be able to compete against other gifted men and women.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I believe that I could be the winner for multiple reasons.

Prior to trying out| I was a very overweight guy. I decided that I wanted to be more than just a regularly everyday beat cop and I did whatever it took to do it. I changed my diet drastically| I worked out every single day| and I went to the track and ran sprints 2-3 times a week.Lastly| I'm very good with people. My career requires me to be able to talk to people all day. Everything I do at work requires interaction with people| and more importantly people who are typically either angry or distressed. I am very good at talking to people and convincing them to do things that they typically wouldn't want to do. I am quite skilled at calming people down when they are upset or angry.",37,0

Playing Scrabble| cosplaying| and memes!Pet peeves:I don't like people making decisions for me| especially without asking my opinion. Never expect a free ride with me if I see you being complacent. I will push you to get up and show initiative. There's nothing that bothers me more than a lazy person who acts privileged around those who've had to work for things their entire life. Oh| and calling me Dave or David instead ofDavie| my momma named me that!Three words to describe you:Uncommon| adventurous| and calculating.What's your personal claim to fame?My online presence.

I have learned so much from him| from leadership skills to dealing with new people and new surroundings.

Rick is dedicated to the title that his group has given him and is a provider for his family and friends| like myself. He has good days and bad days but never gives up. I channel Rick in a crisis and it helps me stable my mind| while having a little fun in the process.If you could have three things on the island what would they be and why?My harmonica. I believe in therapy and relaxation and making my own music will do just that. When I am stressed in the game| I can create this escape mentally and physically and maybe even look for idols in the process or entertain a few people and make friends along the way.My Davy Crockett hat. It's my lucky hat. I have worn it to tests and passed and I have worn it on dates and gotten lucky. When I wear this hat| I channel my best self.My Bible. I believe that Christ strengthens my being and it's important that I review his teachings| especially in times of chaos and struggle.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?Jeremy Collins. He was genuinely a good guy that knew when to speak and knew when to observe| that's my Obama! Also| Tony Vlachos| in that he was an innovative thinker to the game. Finally| Adam Klein in that he's a family man with a giddy sense of humor. They are all winners and so am I!What's your reason for being onSurvivor?I want to prove to myself that I can do this. I was always teased for not playing popular sports like my friends so this would be my ultimate competition. I'm the middle child so almost the black sheep of the family. Both of my brothers are so accomplished so I want to have my own unique medal of self-accomplishment. My secondary motivation is my pack| my huskies. Recently| my beta wolf Luna Moon was hit by a car. I thought she was dead but we were able to save her. However| not without me being in debt. With my winnings| I want to create an insurance company for pet owners so that when things like this happen to us| we won't be faced with the hardest decision of our lives (putting a pet down).Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I understand how packs work. As a Siberian husky breeder| I know that in order to gain the trust of my pups| I have to feed them. I'm a skilled fisherman so as soon as I can get in the water to catch fish for my tribe| I will earn their trust. I also build doghouses and construct kennels for my pups and with my tribe| this would be no different. Creating new innovative| comforting types of shelter will show me as an asset. Lastly| with my pack| I have to be stern with them. I will mingle with the entire tribe| not just a few to show my sociability while also being assertive with them when it's time to put my foot down.",37,0

I've been a fan of the show since the first season| although sometimes I forget some details. My friends think that just because I don't go camping| I can't do it. This is also a social game| not just physical| and I think I can outwit and outlast just being me and using my brains. I also have student loans and a Ph.D to pay. I would also like to win the game for parents and friends. After Hurricane Maria| things got very hectic back home in Puerto Rico| and I would love to be able to help them.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I might not be a physical threat| although I have been doing kickboxing for about four months| but I think studying other contestants| using their weaknesses to my advantage and keeping a good social game| I would win. I am mostly relying on my social game. I will vote off people but my relationships with them would be real. I am a very loyal| honest person| so I would try not to backstab people| but it's a game and I want to win.",37,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy.

Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",38,0

I have played team sports from the time I was four years old and so have always had teammates to rely on when competition was intense. This game will push me to rely on MYSELF| with no parents or teammates who have my back| nobody to lift me up emotionally| and nobody to help me through the physical demands. It will be a true test of MY strengths| my confidence in my social skills| and my individual ability to build alliances that will benefit me| all in a very short and intense time period. The fierce competition from the starting moment is what draws me to this game. This has always been a dream and goal of mine! I told my family when I was seven years old that I would be onSurvivor| and I FINALLY am!My final motivation is that I will be applying to dental school next year which is an extremely expensive dream| so when I am named Sole Survivor I'll be able to pay for this dream without incurring more debt.

Since I was born| we've lived in the same trailer without much change. Ever since I was doing well in school| I feel like eyes have been on me to help us out of stagnation. If I can make some things happen to help us go above and beyond| then you can best believe I'm going to be that breakthrough.Survivormay just be that start for me.

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",39,0

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways! In the ""pinball machine"" of life| one thing can change everything about a person's life. Survivor was that one thing. It gave me opportunities that I only dreamed of| I got to see the world| help make small differences in people's lives| got to meet incredible people across the globe| and brought joy and laughter to my family from all the crazy stories I got to tell after each adventure.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?19 years ago I got let go from a job| had a day off in NYC| and sent a VHS audition tape into CBS on a lark the day before it was due. What happened next literally changed the trajectory of my life. This show has brought happiness and memories to so many people around the world| and it's cool to be a small part of that.How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?The last time I played this game was in 2004 onSurvivor: All Stars... there were no Idols| hidden clues| advantages| or ways to get back into the game.

Sandra Diaz-Twine,"Age:45Previous seasons ofSurvivor:Pearl Islands(winner)|Heroes vs. Villains(winner)|Game ChangersWhat specific accomplishments do you think ultimately earned you the moniker of ""Idol"" when it comes toSurvivor?This is probably the easiest question to answer. I am considered an Idol because I am the only castaway to ever win the game twice and to this day that has never happened again. I won the first season I ever appeared on back in 2003 and also won the second season I ever appeared on back in 2010. I'm not an Idol because I say I'm an Idol| but because my record proves it. Nine years ago and 19 seasons ago I became known as the Queen| and to this day no one has ever come close to tying my record.What do you think you can teach the new castaways to help them become Sole Survivor?I'm an open book when it comes to the seasons I've played in. I plan on sharing all aspects of the game with the castaways. I will be able to discuss situations like being flexible and how to go with the flow when you have no control over what the majority wants to do at a given time. How to build a strong alliance| by trusting people you genuinely like and share common interests with. And that no one is perfect| there's no way to play a perfect game| so when you make a mistake| own it.What part of the game do you think new castaways usually underestimate?The new castaways underestimate how hard the social part of the game truly is. Hard because there's people you will automatically like and people you will automatically dislike. With those you like| you immediately build a bond and trust| yet there can only be one winner. It's easy to vote off people you dislike| but when all those people are gone| now you have to start voting off the ones you consider friends. And these are the friends that you just blindsided and 100 percent of the time are upset that you voted them off and yet you still have to also convince them to give you the million dollar prize. It's really a juggling act.How will being a mentor present a different challenge for you than actually competing in the game?Being a mentor is actually easier than playing the game| because you don't have to focus on the daily aspects ofSurvivor. I know I'm not playing for the million dollars. I know I will not participate in any challenges (hooray). And I know I will never enter the game in some crazy twist. All I have to do is get to know the new players| listen to them carefully| and advise them. In other words| I plan on sharing the knowledge I have gained after playing for 94 consecutive days. I'm going to provide guidance| but at the end of the day each person has to make their own decisions and play their own game.Given that you're not playingSurvivorin the traditional sense| what element of the game are looking forward to NOT having to endure?I'm over the moon knowing I don't have to endure a single challenge the entire season.",39,0
"""Boston"" Rob Mariano","Age:43Previous seasons ofSurvivor:Marquesas|All-Stars|Heroes vs. Villains|Redemption Island(winner)What specific accomplishments do you think ultimately earned you the moniker of ""Idol"" when it comes toSurvivor?I've playedSurvivorfour times over the course of nearly two decades. I have seen the evolution of the game and I am proficient in the three main aspects of the game: the social component| the physical component| and the strategic/psychological component. I wouldn't necessarily call myself an idol—I didn't come up with that idea—but I definitely know what I'm doing!What do you think you can teach the new castaways to help them become Sole Survivor?I understand the basics: everything from how to start a fire| build a shelter| and catch fish. And the more complex| social dynamics of the game—and of course| different strategic approaches.How will being a mentor present a different challenge for you than actually competing in the game?I think the hardest thing about being a mentor for myself is not being able to actually compete. I am competitive by nature| so to stand on the sidelines and watch the game being played is going to be difficult.Given that you're not playingSurvivorin the traditional sense| what element of the game are looking forward to NOT having to endure?The fact that they can't vote me off will give me time to really enjoy the survival aspect of the game (camp life). My background is in construction so I plan to concentrate on building the ultimate shelter. The best oneSurvivorhas ever seen!",39,0

Strategically| my approach would be a hybrid of Devon Pinto—bluffing the dumb role sneakily well—and Boston Rob—impeccable timing of making big moves and sniffing out when people are up to something.What's your primary motivation for being onSurvivor?To challenge myself like I never have before. I spend my life adapting to ever-changing environments. I grew up in a rough inner-city neighborhood and rose above and have been successful in one of the most competitive| cutthroat businesses on Earth. Poker is such a great challenge and competition and I want to always challenge myself to do better and better. There is no greater challenge in life thanSurvivor| I must conquer it.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?Because of the life I have already survived. It was a crazy rough neighborhood I grew up in| but I made it out and I have even traveled to 30 countries since then. I am also a beast at physical challenges. I have a very strong social game and| thanks to my poker skills| I will be able to read people well and will blindside the ""blindsiders."" I will be able to break hearts when I need to| even my own.

In my completely unbiased opinion| it's the greatest TV show of all time.Who is your inspiration in life?My family inspires me every day. They are the most thoughtful| funny| and loving people I have ever met and they always push me to be better.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My family and I have always watchedSurvivortogether so it is pretty sentimental. Being on the show has also allowed me to be involved with theSurvivorcommunity and I am lucky enough to call many of them my friends.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?WinningSurvivorgave me the confidence to know that I can do anything I set my mind to. I did not win by being the smartest or strongest; I won by being myself. I think realizing that in my mid-20s was really pivotal in shaping how I handle challenges.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?As a super fan| I am absolutely honored to be a small part of a huge legacy. Winning my first season was surreal. Now| I get to return with winners that I admire... I am pinching myself.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?I don't think I will play much differently. In my first season| I learned that I am able to calmly adapt to changing circumstances and this is valuable in a game where paranoia runs rampant. Since I am a social player| I will lean into that and make as many personal connections as possible. I would like to make some fun| big moves this time but they have to be smart and not just for shock factor.The one thing that feels really important is advocating for my own story so that at the final Tribal I have a compelling narrative. Lately| we have seen a trend of strong| confident males winningSurvivorso I want to show that you can have a different approach and still be worthy of the title Sole Survivor. The pressure is on this season because everyone wants to prove they are the best to ever play the game so I am expecting fireworks and lots of big moves.,40,0

My family saw it as one of those crazy dreams of mine| and they supported it with curiosity. When they realized how serious I tookSurvivor| and that I was pretty good at it| they threw their full support behind me. For that| I'm super grateful.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?It made me much busier. I give more talks| travel more| and give back more than I had before. Before I made lots of custom furniture for Beve Unlimited and traveled a little for deliveries. Now I still make lots of furniture| but I'm traveling globally for other sorts of opportunities| as well.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?The best season ever was the 10 year anniversary: Season 20|Heroes vs Villains. This will be yet another huge season: Season 40|Winners At War| the first all-winners season. To be a part of it| I'm part of theSurvivorlegacy| and that's something that I've always wanted to accomplish. So I'm just humbled| honored| and grateful to be out here again.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?Last time I was playing for a lot of people back home. I wanted to play it safe to represent well for my family| community| and loved ones back home. I wanted to leave something my little cousins and my niece and nephew could see and be proud of. They have that; I did that. This time I want to loosen up a bit and have some fun out there. Backstab a little bit| and talk even more trash. Shoot at some big dogs| and pull some tricks out. Maybe even do some things that are out of character. Let's see who's out here to really play the game.,40,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",40,0

I felt inspired by this back then| and continue to believe it today.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?I owe my family toSurvivor. I met my wife after we were set up by Brad Virata (my Tribemate fromCook Islands) and now we have two beautiful girls who just watchedSurvivorfor the first time!What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?WinningSurvivorgave me a platform for raising awareness of issues I care about| from diversity in media| to the need for more minority bone marrow donors| to the importance of civic and political engagement. It also gave me a lifelong aversion to eating coconuts.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?It's gratifying to be part of something that changed the media landscape and brought more diversity onscreen to mainstream audiences.Survivorshowed that| regardless of gender or ethnic differences| we're all human beings who share a common capacity for connection| inspiration| and glee over well-executed blindsides.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?When I played onCook Islands| I felt as though I had to walk on eggshells and monitor every word| especially in light of the surprise theme for that season.

I've seen every season and now watch it with my family every week.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Now that our kids are old enough to watch the show... it means enjoying family night while eating Doritos and watchingSurvivor. It's a lot of fun!What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?I met my husband on the show and the rest is history.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?Never expecting to play again... had sort of closed that book. So now that it is open again... it's both nerve-wracking and exciting to ""get back into the game"" and not just watching as a fan| as I've been doing for the past 15 years. I'm so excited that my girls will not just hear about Mommy and Daddy being onSurvivor. Now they will actually be a part of our story and get to watch the season with us when it airs. It's an honor to be a part of another epic season!How will you play differently than you have in past seasons?A lot of time has passed since I last playedSurvivor. Heck| it's been 20 years since I played the first time on Season 2. Not only has the game evolved and changed a lot... so have I. I'm no longer just playing for myself. I'm married with four children who will be closely watching and listening to everything I do and every word I speak. I'm 20 years older too. I was the youngest in my Tribe when I playedSurvivor: The Australian Outback. Now| I'm going to be one of the ""older"" people. People see me in a whole new light. Plus| being married to ""Boston Rob"" paints a HUGE target on my back. When I played the first two times| I didn't have that pressure. So| I guess for me I'm going to try to focus on my social game in a big way and try hard to find Idols/advantages! I'd like to think I'll be good at challenges but let's face it| I am not in the shape I was before having four kids. But I also want to focus on enjoying the experience and showing my girls how strong their mom is! I'll never give up and I'll show them to always go big and finish what you start.

He was in a wheelchair and traveling with an infant and his toddler—and zero support crew. He was smiling. That man blew my mind.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Survivoris my family. My husband competed on Season 29| and I thought he was cute when I saw him on TV. Then we met in real life at a Grassroot Soccer charity soccer tournament hosted by Ethan Zohn| winner ofSurvivor: Africa. And now we have aSurvivorbaby. It's kind of absurd| really.What is one way that playingSurvivorchanged your life?It opened up the competitive beast within| and it also gave me the opportunity to host TV shows| travel around the world as a journalist| and take pics with really excited fans at airports. I played three seasons when I was in my 20s and then processed my experiences for the last decade. I think the main reason that I am able to help people with my work as a life coach and yoga teacher is because I came through such intense experiences playing and winningSurvivorand then afterward with the criticism and reality TV fame. I know what it's like to go after a goal with everything I have. I know in my bones how hard it is to be judged and found lacking. I know the sting of betrayal| and I also know that miracles happen all the time. No matter what it looks like| there is a way through every block.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I am pumped. I thought I was done| but this opportunity to compete with the best of the best is too good to pass up. The game has changed. It's faster| more complex| and people are bolder. I'm excited to get into this more dynamic arena and win a totally new game.How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?I'm sure I will be targeted again right away| like I was onHeroes vs. Villains. So| this time I will have to take into consideration that I may be on the outside looking in at first. There also may be some people playing with me that I have history with—probably not good history—and I will have to clear my mind and see them as totally new| like we're meeting for the first time. I plan to be more aggressive and sneaky in hunting idols| distributing misinformation| letting other people lead and take credit| and really play up that I'm a new mom. I'm definitely not in as good of physical shape as I was the last few times I played| but I have a new stamina and capacity that comes from knowing that I can survive six months of sleep deprivation with a newborn. And| I know that I can connect with people in a completely different way as a mother.,40,0

When you see it... you can feel it... and you can't help but be impacted and inspired by it.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Survivoris something that is a shared experience for all of us. We've laughed| we've cried... and we've hooted and hollered at our TV many times over the years. It's the one time where we don't just slow down—we stop and are all focused 100% on the same thing. It's our time.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?I thinkSurvivorhas changed my life in many ways... but not because of the money. At the core| I remain the person I was before| which until very recently included driving the SAME car| now almost 12 years old| complete with dents and duct tape patching. But playingSurvivorfueled parts of me that were always there| maybe untapped| or maybe pushed me to honor those parts. It's made me more open to life experiences in general| fueled the desire to travel| and now plays a huge part in our family motto of #GoSeeDo (go places we don't normally get to go| see people we don't normally get to see| do things we wouldn't normally do). Ultimately| it was a reminder that life is too short| so suck it up during the crappy parts| and embrace and appreciate the rest.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?It's funny| this answer should be easy... but it's not. Being given the chance to play a second time is huge in and of itself. But for it to be the 40th! EPIC! The game has changed SO much since Season 1 and has brought with it so many incredible players. It feels like a huge honor to be able to be a part of that legacy (even if I was on one of the worst tribes EVER!) so I don't take it lightly.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My honest answer... I have no clue! LOL! Why?? Because we are who we are| good or bad| and once you're out on that island... all of the best-laid plans| intentions| etc. can quickly dissipate into a miserable mess. So in truth| the core of how I played the first time will remain: adapt| adapt| adapt. And hope that theSurvivor""gods"" are in my favor.",40,0

Being a part of this unimaginable milestone of a season is HUGE!How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?I've playedSurvivortwice (Season 28 and 34)—I won once| and lost once. I've learned that my game-winning performance was similar to that of a one-trick pony. There is no way I can perform the same tricks playing withSurvivorlegends and expect to get away with it. Hence my second time playing onGame Changers. Fortunately for me| I'm well aware that I will have to change the way that I'm wired. I will play this season differently by not being as loud/flashy and will try my best to control the votes/game without making it obvious that I'm doing just that. Wish me luck! LOL!,40,1

For example| it was a great escape from the stresses of law school. And on a more serious note| I specifically remember when my mom had recently passed away| I was moved by Rodney grieving the loss of his sister on Season 30. I bawled my eyes out. It was a much-needed therapeutic experience.My family has always watchedSurvivorand tried to watch it together when we could. When my dad came to Fiji for the family visit| it was a monumental experience that strengthened our relationship.

Only two years ago| I was daydreaming about how I could ever even get the opportunity to be cast on the show. Now| I am the winner of one ofSurvivor's greatest seasons| and I am placed in the same category as the legends I used to look up to! It is a great honor. I am aSurvivorlegend! How amazing! What a blessing!How will you play differently than in your past season?When I wonDavid vs. Goliath| I never received a single vote against me. I was able to disguise my strategic ability and knowledge of the game under my country accent and chill demeanor. I was able to fly under the radar and build one-on-one relationships with nearly every single player in the game. This time| if I don't receive a single vote the entire game| I will take it as an insult! Everyone has seen how brilliantly I playSurvivor. These legends won't fall for alliance names and my Kentucky charm as easily as a cast of complete strangers did. I won't be able to hide behind bigger threats. So this time| I'm going to be even more aggressive. In short| I am going to have as much fun as possible in the beginning. This is my dream come true and I want to take it all in. Then| I am going to TURN IT ON. No player will be safe from the Kentucky Nick sneaky ninja assassin blindside! This game is where legends are made!,40,0
