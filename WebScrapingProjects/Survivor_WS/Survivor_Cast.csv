Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title!

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways!

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie.

It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time.

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie.

It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy.

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",10,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch.

It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends.

I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy.

It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy.

Adam Klein,"Hometown:Burlingame| CaliforniaCurrent residence: Los AngelesPrevious season:Winner ofSurvivor: Millennials vs. Gen X(Season 33)Occupation:Keynote speaker and hostHobbies:Board games| poker| travel| and if I am being honest|Survivor.Pet peeves:When you ask someone to take a picture and they take dozens of the exact same photo.Three words to describe you:Personable| determined and caring.When did you first watchSurvivor?Season finale of Season 1. Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",14,0

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways! In the ""pinball machine"" of life| one thing can change everything about a person's life. Survivor was that one thing.

Adam Klein,"Hometown:Burlingame| CaliforniaCurrent residence: Los AngelesPrevious season:Winner ofSurvivor: Millennials vs. Gen X(Season 33)Occupation:Keynote speaker and hostHobbies:Board games| poker| travel| and if I am being honest|Survivor.Pet peeves:When you ask someone to take a picture and they take dozens of the exact same photo.Three words to describe you:Personable| determined and caring.When did you first watchSurvivor?Season finale of Season 1. Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",15,0

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways! In the ""pinball machine"" of life| one thing can change everything about a person's life. Survivor was that one thing.

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",19,0

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",20,0

I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time.

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",27,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy.

It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",28,0

She played a true and honest game. She crushed the challenges and her social skills were top notch.Reason for Being on SURVIVOR:From the birth of Survivor| everyone has told me I would be the best survivor âSurvivorâ ever had. I have diligently put tapes in when I thought the tape was the right time| and I believe years of manifesting and believing in myself and my girls at ages they are at| that this was the time to prove to not only myself but all the thousands of people I know DREAMS COME TRUE! Trick is you have to make them happen and never lose sight of your dreams. Dream Big!!Why You Think Youâll âSurviveâ SURVIVOR:I am a great team player| a very hard worker| a very positive thinker and an incredible people person. I get along instantly with most people. I am not a control freak and I go with the flow.Why You Think You Will Be the Sole SURVIVOR:My greatest strength is my intuition and my people skills. I am a chameleon with people and have an ability to read people and situations with great strength. On top of that| I have a lot of charisma and positive energy| and I am likeable| incredibly agile and a good athlete.Do You Consider Yourself a Brain| a Beauty or a Brawn?I would consider myself a Brawn. I was raised in a home with four very tough brothers who were all incredible hockey players. They used to put me in goal and take slap shots off me from about two feet away when I was in kindergarten. Needless to say| they taught me well. I grew up athletic| tough and confident in the defense of myself and others. My life has been very difficult with many ugly and unpredictable obstacles and I made a conscious choice to never give up on myself or my dreams. I believe it is my God given tenacity and spirit that I was born with that gives me the title: Brawn. As my brother Mark always said so well| I am a TOUGHY TIGER!!Who Do You Think Has the Best Chance in the Game of Survivor: Brains| Beauty or Brawn?I think that the Brawns will win without question as long as they do not allow their egos to take over. I think common sense in the game of Survivor is essential and often times really smart people lack that. I also think it is one thing to be able to build a spaceship and whole different story when it comes to building a shelter and toughing it out in the woods. Beauty is just beauty. How do you build shelter| fires and boil your own water on your looks? I think a Brawn will win.Watch Trish's Cast Video!,28,0

I would say you want to possess all those qualities in order to win Survivor. If I had to choose one| I would say Brawn because as sports athletes they understand pressure situations of competition (composure). They have the where with all of team play| and with the structure of the game of survivor in order to advance in the game you need the help of your teammates (supportive). Brain's would fail because of their know-it-all attitudes (conflicting). The Beauties would fail because they will sit back and expect everything to be handed to them.Watch Woo's Cast Video!",28,0

It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",29,0

Adam Klein,"Hometown:Burlingame| CaliforniaCurrent residence: Los AngelesPrevious season:Winner ofSurvivor: Millennials vs. Gen X(Season 33)Occupation:Keynote speaker and hostHobbies:Board games| poker| travel| and if I am being honest|Survivor.Pet peeves:When you ask someone to take a picture and they take dozens of the exact same photo.Three words to describe you:Personable| determined and caring.When did you first watchSurvivor?Season finale of Season 1. Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",31,0

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways! In the ""pinball machine"" of life| one thing can change everything about a person's life. Survivor was that one thing. It gave me opportunities that I only dreamed of| I got to see the world| help make small differences in people's lives| got to meet incredible people across the globe| and brought joy and laughter to my family from all the crazy stories I got to tell after each adventure.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?19 years ago I got let go from a job| had a day off in NYC| and sent a VHS audition tape into CBS on a lark the day before it was due. What happened next literally changed the trajectory of my life. This show has brought happiness and memories to so many people around the world| and it's cool to be a small part of that.How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?The last time I played this game was in 2004 onSurvivor: All Stars... there were no Idols| hidden clues| advantages| or ways to get back into the game. And get thisâwe actually had to survive! The game has changed and so have I. I plan to adapt| have fun and push my mind| body| and spirit to the max.",31,0

During that time| raising children as a single parent was be extremely hard| but the strength the women of my family showedâtheir will to never give up| their triumph over sweat and tearsâshaped me into the woman I am today.We are strong and most of the women I grew up with also demonstrate that same strength and willpower.

It would help a lot if we would learn to listen to the younger generation and run with some of their new ideas.Personal claim to fame:Besides my four amazing kids| I'm most proud of being a breast cancer survivor. After five surgeries| eight rounds of chemotherapy| and 28 days of radiationânot to mention the horrible meds they put you onâI'm still here! It was important to me that my kids saw me as a ""warrior|"" rather than as a whiner. Of course| it was hard| but I wouldn't let cancer take over my life. Because of my faith| I was able to kick cancer's butt!Inspiration in life:My inspiration comes from my relationship with the Lord. My faith has shaped my attitude in life and has given me the ability to be genuinely happy. Aside from my faith| my mom is my hero. She is the toughest lady.

No matter what happens| she keeps getting back up and going again!If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?A deck of cards because I love playing games and it helps break down walls with people you don't know; lip gloss because I always feel a little better about myself with a little color on my lips; and '80s music because I love singing with friends and| no matter how off-key you all are| it's always fun.Survivorcontestant you're most like:I'd play the game most likeLisa Whelchel(Philippines). I see a lot of myself in her. Not only has she been through difficult times| but her faith stayed intact. We're both moms and I see myself ""mothering"" some of the younger players| as she did. I see myself trying my best to play the game according to my faith| yet making sure I actually play the game. I know there will come a point I will have to deceive to get ahead; I plan to do it in the context of the game.Reason for being onSurvivor:My primary motivation is of course a $1 million! Second| I want to prove to myself that I can do it. As a fan of the show from the very first season| I've spent hours dreaming about being on the island| making alliances| finding hidden Immunity Idols| and| most of all| walking away with the title of Sole Survivor!Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I believe my strong personality will keep me going on the island. I know I'm good with people| especially young people because I work with them for a living| and this will help me gain allies on my tribe.

I've dreamed of starving on desert beaches and running around in my unwashed underwear for years! It's long been my desire forJeff Probstto reward my mastery of lying and manipulation with $1 million dollars.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I'm tough as nails. Try and tear me down. Furthermore| people fascinate me. I can get along with anyone because I tend to be more curious than judgmental of an individual's quirks than judgmental.

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",34,0

After surviving loneliness| starvation| physical exhaustion| and exposure to the elements| I just can't allow silly things like âwhat-if"" scenarios to have control over me.Also| I find that my reaction is to laugh at ridiculous things as opposed to becoming upset or angry.

I also would have called out Kim Spradlin (eventual winner ofSurvivor: One World) in front of the entire tribe daily!I was putting too much thought into winning challenges as opposed to letting the tribe see the obvious plan Kim had. My mistake.How will you play differently this time?Iâve realized this is an âoutwitâ game more than anything else. Iâll try to keep the bullseye off my back by not showing ALL my cards| like the last time I played.And| at all costs| ALWAYS in ALL ways keep a person around whoâs a bigger target than myself. Keep your friends close and kiss your enemies!,34,0
Zeke Smith,Age: 28Hometown: Brooklyn| NYPreviously played on:Season 33:Millennials Vs. Gen X| Finished 9th & Jury MemberHow have you changed since the last time you played?Since I just played| I donât think Iâve changed at all. Iâm still digging sand out of my tush. I keep leaving the apartment barefoot. Iâve taken to sleeping on my neighbor's floor so thereâs someone to wake me during my night terrors. They know itâs time to shake me awake when I start screaming| âDave found another Idol!âWhat skills do you bring toSurvivorthat will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?New skills? Well| I went to a friendâs party in workout clothes. I brought my own salad| which I ate in a corner and refused to speak to anyone. So| yeah| I can do that now.What are you most proud of from the last time?Iâm not quite sure. Itâs really all a blur. I remember something about forcing rocks to save myself. What| if anything| do you most regret? Nothing. Everything. Nothing. Everything. Chris.How will you play differently this time?Frankly| I donât exactly know what I did right or wrong last time but| I think I played too flashy. This go âround| Iâm going to play more subtly| because Iâm a very subtle person.Take one look at me and you think| âThis guy knows subtle. No part of his mustache or patterned shirts or style of speaking says| âpay attention to me!ââ,34,0

I was a strong competitor in every challenge.What| if anything| do you most regret?I regret not making a big move and to win| you have to. This time I am willing and ready to do whatever it takes.How will you play differently this time?Last time| I focused too much on my social game. I know itâs important| but I need to use the friendships I make to an advantage. I want to make big moves| blindsides| and do things that make me worthy to win. I am a physically strong competitor.

I will always play with all my heart| which has allowed me to overcome many obstacles in my life.I plan to build a very strong team and lead them to the merge. From there| Iâll have to play with the hand I'm dealt to the best of my ability.What are you most proud of from the last time?My ability to understand that I would have to make a big move to win the game and my guts to act on it.What| if anything| do you most regret?I most regret the moment I climbed down from the pole in the Immunity Challenge that led to my dismissal. I knew it would be hard to win| so I let myself climb down. If I hadnât climbed down| I could have held onto the pole for a lot longer.I let myself take the easy way out| which is hardly ever the best decision. Hunger and conditions clouded my judgment without me recognizing it.How will you play differently this time?I will be more careful about picking my allies. More importantly| I will play a more aggressive Idol-tracking game| and a more determined and fierce challenge game.,34,0
Tai Trang,Age: 52Hometown: San Francisco| CAPreviously played on:Season 32:Brain Vs. Brawn Vs. Beauty| 2nd Runner-upHow have you changed since the last time you played?After playing and watching my season unfold| I am more aware and appreciative of how complexSurvivoris. I see my pitfalls and how I can improve. It's a delicate balance of being true to oneself and developing trust and friendships| while at the same time knowing who I think I can beat at the end.I hope I have not become jaded or less trustful now. Each game is unique with its own dynamics and I just need to be open and see where it takes me. I need the knowledge from my past season| but not baggage.Survivoris so great and winning is my ultimate goal.What skills do you bring toSurvivorthat will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?I have proven that I work hard and am helpful around camp. I can start a fire and keep it going. I am resourceful and can forage and fish for food.I am loyal| a nice guy| and get along well with everyone. I am pretty positive and can keep thing light and bring harmony to camp.

I am also trying to improve my lousy hand and eye coordination by playing in a Bocce ball league.What are you most proud of from the last time?Blindsiding Scot [and] Jason| and sending Scot home. I am proud that I broke away from their alliance to have a voice and played my own game. Deciding on my own destiny resulted in making the Final 3.And| yes| I am so happy to have saved Mark| the chicken. I worked really hard foraging for food so others didn't eat him.I am also proud to bring awareness to how we humans need to take care of our environment and have compassion for other living things.What| if anything| do you most regret?I regret not managing the Jury better and not being able to articulate| own| and defend all that I accomplished during the game. I regret spending so much time and energy providing for camp which took me away from the game play.Toward the end| I was completely depleted which affected how I played and performed at the final Tribal.How will you play differently this time?I am much more confident about the game now. I know I have a lot to offer and I can get along with everyone; now it's time to create strong relationships. It's good to have friends in both an alliance and on the Jury. I will be much more observant and aware of my position within the rest of the tribe.I need to be more flexible and fluid in this ever-changing game of strategy| focusing on the bigger picture of winning the game rather than personal friendships. Most of all| I would like to be myself| take risks| and have fun hanging with all these bigSurvivorlegends.,34,0
Jeff Varner,Age: 50Hometown: High Point| NCPreviously played on:Season 2:Australia| Finished 10th out of 16 & Non-JurySeason 31:Second Chances| Finished 17thHow have you changed since the last time you played?Iâm more physically fit| less emotional| and smarter. I'm still me and could pop off at any time without warning| but I'm focused on being calmer.I'm honored to be part of this cast and aware this could be the last time I'm ever on aSurvivorisland| so I want to soak up the surroundings| beauty| and energy of being part of this landmark series.I just played this game| so the excitement of being back is more tempered by a focus to not get too carried away.What skills do you bring toSurvivorthat will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?Iâll be much more useful at challenges and intend to be more instrumental around camp. I want strong relationships when this is over| but already have a host of great friends.I make mistakes| but I'm a good person with a good heart. I hope America sees that. But if my competition doesn't| their loss.What are you most proud of from the last time?Being chosen by America| by far! Also| my instinctual gameplay. My ability to control a volatile group of people and be the determining factor as to who went home on the first two boots.What| if anything| do you most regret?Going too hard| too soon. Playing with too much emotion in the beginning. Drawing the Angkor buff. No matter how good of a game you're playing| drawing the wrong buff can change everything.How will you play differently this time?I want to have more fun this time. Iâll combine my Outback and Cambodia stylesâhard gameplay with a more subtle approach. I plan to try and control my emotions more. As best as circumstances allow| Iâll manage a swap better.I plan to align myself with the big threats. Even if I end up in the minority after a swap| I'll make sure there is someone else with me who is more of a target.This time| itâs all business. I'd love to make the Jury finally| but if I don't| I want to make sure I've soaked it all up in a way that it's okay.,34,0

Just kidding. I'm older| but definitelynotwiser. You will see the same guy in this season as you saw in Cagayan.What skills do you bring toSurvivorthat will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?Unfortunately| the skills I bring toSurvivorare skills that will NOT make me a useful member. Instead| they will make me a very threatening member.I haven't learned any new skills since I played on Cagayan| which could be my downfall going back on an all returnee season. I wish I could have learned the skill of being able to be quiet and try to play under the radar| but I don't see that happening. Itâs just not in my DNA.What are you most proud of from the last time?WINNING!!What| if anything| do you most regret?There is seriously nothing I regret. Everything I did on Cagayan was on the fly. Some things were based off of emotion| some based off of strategy| but nothing was based off of malice.In the end| it all fell into place and I became the Sole Survivor.How will you play differently this time?Going into the game this time around| with all the players knowing my game style| I know that I'm going to be a huge threat. Having said that| I know I will have to take it down a few notches until I can plant my roots.Knowing myself| I wonât be able to take it down any notches and will be in trouble. I hope I have what it takes to adapt right away and ""go with the flow""âif thatâs even possible for me to do.I will have my fingers crossed for sure!",34,0
Debbie Wanner,Age: 51Hometown: Reading| PAPreviously played on:Season 32:Brains Vs. Brawn Vs. Beauty| Finished 9thHow have you changed since the last time you played?For all the magic and mystery in playingSurvivor| I'm more patently aware of how people can see and hear the exact same event/conversation and have widely different opinions/reactions/interpretations of said event.I'm making a concerted effort to view situations through other people's minds and eyes.What skills do you bring toSurvivorthat will make you a useful member of the group and what skills have you been learning since you last played?I'm a worker around camp and wasâand willâbe a contributor; do what you can to make camp as hospitable as it can be| given the savagery of the environment and the fierce competition. When it comes to voting someone out at Tribal| I want to keep in mind just one thing: any name but mine will do just fine.What are you most proud of from the last time?For all its strange alchemy and upheavals of emotion| energy| and stomach| I enjoyed it all with exuberance and an ability to laugh and forgive myself and others.What| if anything| do you most regret?Not making more of an effort to reach out to Scot and Jason. Everyone and anyone can be an ally| if only for one vote.How will you play differently this time?Attempt to reach out to as many people as possible while still maintaining sincerity and decency. I know we are just playing a game| but attachments happen| and feelings really do get bruised.If I'm going to lie| I hope not to be too much of a wanker about it. Keep the lines of communication open to all and try not to let slights| injustices| real or imagined| get to me.Perhaps gain 10 lbs| as well; foraging for food often uses more energy than we got from finally eating it.Survivoris EXHAUSTING| mentally and physically| I'd like to keep a mental picture of many rescued animals| safe and happy| to remind me of why I'm playing again.,34,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",35,0

It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy.

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends.

I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time.

Before her birth I was very overweight| smoked cigarettes| dabbled quite a bit at the craps table and would most likely be sitting down at the poker table on any given day. I recall a specific moment when my daughter was about a year old and she wanted me to take her outside on the swings. It was chilly that day so I had to dress warm. While putting on my shoes| I recall panting from being out of breath from the simple act of tying my own shoes.It was at that moment that I knew I had to make a change so that I would be around a long time for her and my other children that were soon to come.

He wins in the emotional intelligence category that allows him to morph into whatever he needs to at the time. He also understands the importance of stroking other people's egos when he needs to. This is something I hope I am capable of doing. And finally Rob Mariano| for the simple fact that we both come from Italian families with a background in construction. But more importantly| he sees the game big picture which is critical and I hope I can maintain.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?Obviously this is the opportunity of a lifetime to play this game| but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take a forced break from real life. And I don't mean that I am happy to leave my family or my job| but this game will force me to be away from my life for a set period of time which I hope will open my eyes to what's important when I get home.

My dad is one of the hardest working people I know. My mom tutors incarcerated women| volunteers on Election Day| and contributes to our local community in a loving| selfless way.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?A bag of Skittles. I'm addicted to candy and just one Skittle a day would keep me going through starvation! Next| a deck of cards so I could get people to play games that require deceit| and try to read tells| and tampons| because| duh.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I hope I'm a mix between Kelley Wentworth and Aubry Bracco. Kelley is a badass game player who would do anything to win. She gets people to trust her and is still a snake. I'm also a little bit Aubryâstrategic| very intuitive| but slightly neurotic and quirky.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?As Probst says|Survivoris a human experiment. I am fascinated| as a huge fan| to watch how people interact and deceive when pushed to their limits. Can't wait to have a front row seat! I want to prove to myself that I can take on this insane physical and mental challenge.Survivoris the greatest game on earth| and I'd like to try my hand at it.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I will survive because of my innate ability to make people feel comfortable. I don't give up. I'm a resilient person who has done a lot to design my own life. I have the mental and physical stamina to last| even if I don't look like it.

I think it's important to not only maintain healthy relationships with friends and family| but also to make a difference in a total stranger's life. I don't care what type of person you are| seeing someone better off because of something you did changes you for the better. Pay it forward| people. Even the smallest gesture can make a large impact!Who or what is your inspiration in life?I'd say my daily hopes and dreams are inspired by all of the unique creatures| cultures| and nature that surrounds us on this planet.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?First| lemons to flavor my water/food and bleach my hair. Second would be Mentos gum to chew| and finally| pen and paper to document my journey/write love letters to a hot castaway.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?Because why the hell not? Literally can't think of a single reason why anyone would say no to an experience of a lifetime. Life is too short to not say ""YES.""Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I have been able to manifest anything and everything I've ever wanted in my lifeâit's pretty cool. Not to brag| but I say I want something and I always get it. So hopefully by saying ""I'll survive|"" I will win or at least come out of the experience with nothing but a profound appreciation of what I just accomplished.",36,0
Jacob Derwin,"Age:22Hometown:Merrick| New YorkCurrent residence:Brooklyn| New YorkOccupation:Music TeacherHobbies:Songwriting and performing those songs| telling storiesâbe that on stage or just to friendsâand cooking with my mom. Shut up| it makes me happy! Also| I listen to a ton of podcasts| attend as many concerts as I possibly can| and spend a great deal of time panicking over current political events.Pet peeves:When people let little discomforts spoil an entire experience. When people feel a need to complain constantly| even when there's nothing to complain about. The worst| though? When people don't have a sense of humor. Laugh| dammit!Three words to describe you:Self-deprecating| charming| and affableâthough others would say ""punchable.""What's your personal claim to fame?Nothing feels better than hearing your own music for the millionth time and still enjoying it. And even better| when other people hear your music for the first time and it makes them cry. You can't fake those kinds of responses. It's the best. Cheesy? Maybe. True? You bet| man.Who or what is your inspiration in life?I have a few but I suppose Robin Williams is the most well-known one. When I was a little kid| Genie fromAladdinwas my entire sense of humor. That wild| a-hundred-jokes-a-minute pacing| all the voices and wackiness completely dazzled me. As I got older| I got to appreciate all his other amazing roles and unabashedly nutty stand-up routines. I'm often told I'm too loud. I blame that entirely on Robin Williams.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?First would be my guitar because it gives me something I can focus on outside of the game. Next| one of those daily joke calendars because not only is it great for keeping track of time| but if your situation isn't providing many laughs| it's good to have a reliable way to find some. Finally| beard oil. I bought my first vile of this stuff about a year ago and it's the best feeling thing ever. Plus| it's really fun to respond to ""Are you wearing cologne?"" with ""No| just beard oil.""WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I've always felt like I related most to Stephen Fishbach| though I see a lot of David Wright in me as well. I'm a funny| nerdy| neurotic Jewish guy trying to make it in the entertainment business. I'm logical and smart (I like to think)| but I've spent plenty of time crying in private.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?I've been dreaming of doing this for well over a decade. At this point| above all else| it's to prove I can do what I've been saying I could do since I was a kid: WinSurvivor. Part pride| part sticking it to the kids who tortured me growing up. It's a ""What have you accomplished?"" kind of thing. I promise I'm not usually so vengeful!Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?This sounds stupid| but I'm really easy to talk to. I want to set up my situation so everyone knows they can come to me to chat and get support despite any problems they're having personally or socially in the game. I'm a teddy bear| y'know? On top of that| I'm not a weakling. I can haul firewood and follow instructions when it comes to building shelters. I know how to make fire and untie knots and all that.",36,0
Stephanie Gonzalez,"Age:26Hometown:Aguada| Puerto RicoCurrent residence:Ocala| FloridaOccupation:Graphic SalesHobbies:Paintball| working out| running| free diving| snorkeling| being in nature| anything involving the ocean| and I LOVE race/stunt cars drag race. Yes I'm a little bit of a tom boy and not at all ashamed.Pet peeves:Complainers! People who feel entitled to everything without working for it. Also| annoying laughs| arrogant men| racism| bullies| and pretty boys.Three words to describe you:Outspoken| strong-willed| and strategic.What's your personal claim to fame?I was promoted to Senior Surgery Technician after only one year of long hours and sleepless nights of on call emergency surgeries. Meanwhile I was taking care of 14 foaling babies (horses) at home in exchange for rent.Who or what is your inspiration in life?Not to be the clichÃ© but my mother| reasons being I would not be here if she decided to abort (which was highly recommended by her doctors due to health issues when pregnant with me)| Thanks for rebelling Mom! I am grateful for the woman she is and instilling in me the fighter I've become. She recently overcame skin cancer with a smile on her face. She's had to work hard and reconstruct her life after some health issues and losing close family members. She is a genuinely kind| graceful woman with fire in her heart. She works with handicapped children which has been a dream of hers. She reminds me I have a bigger purpose in life.I've always really appreciated her strong support in my way of thinking and encouraged me to keep being an extraordinary human being. In other words| having a strong personality and being weird is cool in her book. That normal is boring and with that| normal woman rarely go down in history. To always do everything in life wholeheartedly. It's an ""all or nothing"" kind of life in my mom's eyes. I couldn't agree more with that woman.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?A small plush panda teddy bear my mom gave me. It's special because she calls it my guardian angel. It really is the little things in life. A small bottle of my dad's cologne. He is the one who always pushes me to do better than the best| to be tougher. Being able to smell his cologne will feel like he is right next to me talking words of wisdom and encouragement. I was always a daddy's girl| and most importantly I have this bracelet that says ""ONE MILLION WIN"" (cause Sole Survivor would be a bit too cheesy even for me). It's gold on black strings and it serves as my reminder of how bad I need to win Sole Survivor. I never take it off.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I would play like a combination of people. First would be Tony Vlachos who actually goes out and hunts for idols when no one's paying attention. Next would be to play challenges like challenge beast Kelly Wiglesworth. I'm also going to go for a nice little four win streak. Also| Brenda Lowe who can't help but be expressive| kind but is a total badass in challenges| and finally| Sandra who I can identify with socially in her sassy attitude and manipulative ways.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?One million dollars is a huge motivating factor for me. The bragging right of forever being a legendary Sole Survivor and being 1 of 16 women to win will be nothing short of amazing| but a million dollars is life changing! It would give me the freedom to be able to have a home and not continue to move from crappy apartment to crappy apartment. It would allow me to pursue investing and financial growth which I can turn into my lifelong goal of living a philanthropic life.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?Because of my hell-bent determination and strong will to win. I put my heart into everything I do. I wanted to go to school| so I worked three jobs to pay for it| along with 1|000 hours of internships to graduate. In business I wanted to help my brother and we grew the business from one store to three stores. I know in my heart that I can win. I welcome all challenges with open arms and can read people really well.Socially| it'll be fun to test waters on how diverse I can be in order to really connect with people. After all| I have to cater to people's personalities so they'll feel comfortable doing what I need. Once my heart is set I will stop at nothing until I've achieved my goal even through blood| sweat| and tears. I've studiedSurvivorwell enough to understand how to manipulate the numbers| play idols how they should be played and hustle the social game. I will go into this with focus| agility| and perseverance.",36,0

I'd do anything for them or to make their lives better.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?First| my brush to take care of my beautiful beard and fro. Second| a chainsaw so I can make building things a lot easier| and finally| a sketchbook so I can doodle| draw| and write.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I think I'd play the game like Jeremy Collins because I'll always keep my heart in the right place| but I'll still be a serious competitor and threat.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?I've been a big fan for a while| and I've always wanted to push myself to the limits and see if I can really survive. Oh yeah| I'm playing for the million bucks| too. That would really help things.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I'm good with people and likable. I'm very diplomatic and can connect with people from different walks of life. I'm also not the biggest and strongest looking person| though I can compete with the best of them. That will get me past the first few votes. Then| my athleticism and skill at puzzles will help me win challenges when it becomes an individual game. Finally| my persuasive skills in front of a jury will win me the million. Boom.",36,1

It is D-O-N-A-T-H-A-N| not Jonathan or Donovan.Three words to describe you:Determined| whimsical| and rare.What's your personal claim to fame?I was a part of a national and state level winning dance team. I danced in the hip-hop routine. I am proud of being openly gay and dancing in front of thousands in this area. My goal is always to try to change the opinions of others when it comes to the LGBTQ community and through dancing| I was able to open the arms of many.There will never be another me when it comes to those years and for that impact| I feel very accomplished. Being the only guy to hold a national championship among the basketball| football and baseball guysâyeah| that felt really nice!Who or what is your inspiration in life?My hero is my grandmother| Deloris Bentley. Always has been| always will be. My grandmother had seven children between the years of 1960-1968| with my mom being the youngest. She raised them all with very limited food| no power until 1975| no bathrooms| only outhousesâall while dealing with the day-to-day struggles of having an alcoholic as a husband.Over the years| things got better for her. She raised her children| divorced and re-married (twice)| and ended up being very independent and open-minded! In 2006| she had a brain aneurysm. She flew out to have emergency surgery and you know what saved her that time? Her blood was so thick from smoking three packs a day for so many years| that the aneurysm was sealed shut.After her surgery| she was up the next morning eating on some ice. Now if that isn't inspiring| I don't know what is! She has always been the glue in our family. She is such a hero in my eyes because of all the sacrifices| determination and selflessness she has expressed and shown all her life! Many people are probably picking celebrities and all that jazz| but my little 'ole Maw Maw is my hero.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?My cross necklace my grandmother got for me| my glasses (if that counts) so I can snap them in half to help with making fire| and just the clothes on my back.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?While there are tons of castaways that I have related to| especially those from the LGBTQ community (Colton| Todd| Tia)| and my hillbillies (Keith| Sandy| JT)| I always find the most relatable to be Cirie.No one expected the gameplay Cirie played in her first season. She went out there| hated leaves| and really didn't know much about the game. But you know what? She went out there and learned the way. She kept her mouth shut when need be| made the big moves when she needed to| and had a great sense of the people on the island what they were thinking.She is the type of player I see myself being. I adore her| and it doesn't hurt that her birthday is July 18th and mine July 19th. We Cancers just have a way about us that is charming| yet manipulative. Our knife is always ready for backs (figuratively)!What's your reason for being onSurvivor?It's for me and my family. We have always been below the poverty line. We have always struggled year to year to make ends meet. But it does make you stronger having to live that way. But you know what? I am tired of living this life.I want to be a great influence for my familyâprove to them that when you try| things can happen. It takes you to put the first foot in the door| no one else. I don't want to end up being stuck here in a rusted old trailer. I want more for my family| especially my mom and grandmother| and also help those in my area who are less fortunate.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?Living in Eastern Kentucky has its perks. We are outdoors people. We love the lakes| we love to roam trails and mountains| and I have learned a lot about nature and survival. And while I have never been in a dire situation to use these skills| I truly believe when the survivalist in me kicks in| I would have a lot to offer.Now darlin'| I ain't no lumberjack. But I can offer common sense solutions in order to help make my tribe grow. I already plan on breaking my glasses to help with fire and prove that this little gay hillbilly nerd isn't afraid of what nature can bring! I really think I will surprise a lot of people.",36,0

It's one thing to compete at the highest level| but it's another to win and be the best at it.Who or what is your inspiration in life?My parentsâfor their dedication| support| and all the values they instilled in me.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?Crossword puzzle book to keep my mind sharp| keep me sane| and give me a way to tune everyone out| a camera to capture every single moment| and a self-addressed envelopeâso there's no confusion as to where to send the million dollar check to.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?Todd. I'll be a smart player| shrewd| and pulling all the strings| a snake (but unbeknownst to others)| and run circles around anyone in a final tribal speech. Also| Sophie. Not afraid to get stuff done| stand up for myself| and tell the boys what to do. I'll be the smartest player there.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?The title of Sole Survivor and the challenge.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I'm a triple threat to win this gameâI'm a former college athlete| an Ivy League graduate| and I know the game better than anyone else out there.

Is wine considered a hobby too?Pet peeves:When I run out of wine.Three words to describe you:Wild| determined| and passionate.What's your personal claim to fame?Ironman. I'm most proud of not just the finish line at the event but the dedication to the training as a working single mom that went behind it. It made me a better human and changed my kids and my life. My racing is always a family affair and I couldn't do it without my two little cheerleaders. Also| I've done a lot of solo traveling. I've been to 24 countries and six continents. Backpacking and trekking solo is a massive passion of mine and feeds my wanderlust soul. It is adventurous and crazy at times but it's shaped me more than anything else in life.Who or what is your inspiration in life?Bob Scott. 87 years old. He is my angel. I met him the week of my divorce and two weeks after his wife passed away. I like to think his angel wife brought us together. He taught me to swim shortly after we met because he wanted me to be a ""happy and fit mom"" for my boys. He helped me learn to ride a triathlon bike. He introduced me to the world of triathlon| which changed my world. He competed alongside me at my first half Ironman and full Ironman and still competes to this day. Bob taught me the sport is about fun| fitness| and friends and that to do this for life and be just like him| I had to keep this mentality. We still train together each week as well as compete alongside each other.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?Lipstick! Because I even wear it when I do my Ironman races! Next would be ear plugs because I'm an insanely light sleeper and hate snorers| and a piece of Rose Quartz because it's my favorite stone and would remind me to follow my heart and trust my intuition.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?A combo of Parvati for her heart and inner strength| Tyson for his sarcasm| Ozzy for his love of adventure| Courtney for her sass| and Mama C for being a strong and fierce mom.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?The adventure. I've watched every single episode ofSurvivorsince it began 18 years ago and the adventure of the show keeps me coming back for more and applying over and over and over! And the social game! I have wanted to play the social game since the first season. Ever since I taught English in Russia in college and was dropped into Siberia with a random mix of girls I have loved the social game of learning to get along with people in a group setting and finding out what makes people tick. That's why I love traveling solo too| because I like to meet and connect with other people from different beliefs and backgrounds.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?Because every day for the past 10 years| I have looked at a sticker on my mirror: ""Outwit| Outlast| Outplay.Survivor."" I never once have stopped believing that this dream would come true. I can have all the strategy in the world and I will! But if I have learned anything from watching the show| participating in endurance events| raising children| working in a fast-paced finance position| studying in an ashram| being an entrepreneur| or all my other adventures is that nothing turns out like you expect. I am really good at adapting to circumstances| to people| and to unlikely situations. Plan A quickly becomes Plan C and it doesn't shake me up. I can endure pain both mental and physical with a smile on my face. Adaptation. A sense of humor. Dreaming big. That embodies who I am and why I will win!",36,0

But really| I am most proud of getting into UCLA Law| one of the best law schools in the country. Additionally| making it through the first year of law school taught me a lot about drive and perseverance.Who or what is your inspiration in life?I don't have a particular source of inspiration in life because I don't believe in emulating or worshipping anyone. I think that everyone has positive traits to draw from as well as less desirable aspects.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?First| a notebook and pen to organize my thoughts and strategy. Second| my retainers because I have had my braces off for over a decade but am still too scared to try not wearing them. What if my pearly whites started moving around? And finally| a bottle of rum because no self-respecting sailor would be caught on a remote island without rum.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?I am passionate| competitive| and neurotic like Spencer. Also| I have the same penchant as him for making people feel irrelevant and that is something I will have to be very careful not to do during the game.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?To take a shot at playing a game I have watched religiously and loved since I was 9. I'd also like to win the million so I can pay off my student loans and then buy a sailboat and sail around the world.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I like to lead people and take initiative.

He came from nothing to overcome tremendous odds and so much adversity and always exemplified love for family along the way. He passed away a couple of years ago but remains an inspiration in everything I do.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?First| a photo of my family. They'll be a source of emotional strength no matter how tough it gets out there. Second would be an American flag because being a first-generation American is one of the greatest sources of pride and willpower for me. Finally| a journal and pen to take notes on the game as it develops and also to keep a diary during the adventure of a lifetime.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?Yul Kwon. Our backgrounds are uncannily similar as Korean-American management consultants| and I plan to follow his example in being cool| calm| and collected throughout the game. Yul'sSurvivorjourney contributed greatly to the positive representation of Asian-Americans on TV| and I hope to do the same.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?Survivoris an adventure like no other. Everything it presentsâthe wilderness| the challenges| the fellow castaways from all cross-sections of Americaâwill be a chance for me to break out of the bubble I've been a part of for most of my life and push myself physically| emotionally| and mentally like never before. I'll embrace the challenge and have fun along the way.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?There is no magic formula to winningSurvivor. However| there are qualities that will help players get far. I believe I have most of themâI am team-oriented| athletic| outgoing| and tenacious.

Chris Noble,"Age:27Hometown:Florida Keys| FloridaCurrent residence:Brooklyn| New YorkOccupation:Male ModelHobbies:Traveling| sports| being a foodie| adrenaline seeking| working out| and dating.Pet peeves:My pet peeves are certain characteristics of people. If you are lazy and also a liar| I won't like you. In fact| it angers me when people act lazy and try to manipulate everyone around them and ruin everything. Now| those pet peeves are going to be alive and well in the land ofSurvivor. Good thing I know how to dish it right back. I have been around people like that my whole life and I know how to deal with it. So yeah| my title of Most Dramatic| in the face of a bunch of liars will be| shall we say... interesting.Three words to describe you:Ambitious| charismatic| and charming.What's your personal claim to fame?My greatest accomplishment was being on a 5th Avenue Versace billboard! It was by no means the end all and be all of where I want to be in life| but it was a major accomplishment. To me it was an accumulation of everything I've worked hard for finally getting justified. It was a huge symbol of perseverance and it was gratifying. I rely on my own self-motivation and have accomplished stuff that was difficult and took legit perseverance| but winningSurvivorwill top all that.Who or what is your inspiration in life?My ma is my hero. But it wasn't always so. Growing up| my mom and I didn't have the best relationship. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) at 27 and had me at 34. God bless her. A lot of side effects of MS don't just affect the body| but the brain as well| such as depression. So as a kid| I couldn't handle or understand what was going on. I look back at my childhood and most memories of my mom and I were difficult. She would have seizures during my baseball games| at my school where she tutored| and the side effects of all the medications made it difficult to have a normal relationship with her.When I was 12| my parents split and the next couple years were even tougher as her disease progressed. If it wasn't for my father telling me I needed to rise above the past and grow up| I would have continued to struggle. When I was told she had two months to live I decided to become a man at 17| and our past struggles brought us even closer. Through the years| our relationship grew| and our love and respect for each other brought our relationship to all-time highs. None of this would be possible if she hadn't beat the odds for almost 10 years now.I will always idolize her perseverance| her grit| and her faith in God. She is the greatest hero anyone can have and I live through her. She never quit or gave in when she was told she had two months to live| so why should I ever quit or give in when life ""gets hard?"" Want to talk about a survivor? That's my mom.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?First would be a good luck necklace my mom gave me when she almost died. I've been wearing it ever since and crazy good things have happened since. Also| lotion| so I could give awesome massages and bond with the hot girls on my tribe| and finally a second bottle of lotionâI plan to be on the island for a while| and maybe I'll get one if I play my cards right!WhichSurvivorcontestant are you most like?From Season 33| I would be a mix of Ken and Michaela. I would provide food like Ken. But unlike Ken| my social game would be on point. I would have Michaela's fire| determination| and athletic ability. I would also be blunt like her| but would do a better job of building relationships. In previous seasons| I would have the social and ladies game like Joe. Joe is eye candy and smooth. I would try and form a coalition with someone like him. He would be my shield and then I would cut him later in the game. As far as Season 36| I won't know whether to play the game like a Florida pantherâstealthy and in the shadows| or like a lionâdominating its tribe. I may have to be both| depending on the dynamic of the game.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?The game itself| and to spread the awareness of MS. 2.3 million people worldwide have MS and there is no cure! For me| like life| I've been finding ways to survive for a long time. I want to apply all my experiences with different personalities| and put them to the ultimate test.

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",37,0

I will mingle with the entire tribe| not just a few to show my sociability while also being assertive with them when it's time to put my foot down.",37,0

Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",38,0

I try to remember that 99.9 percent of the time I am NOT the smartest| coolest| most interesting| deserving| or important person in the room.Three words to describe you:Enthusiastic| outgoing| and spontaneous.What is your personal claim to fame?I am extremely proud of my profession. It was a lot of hard work and took some serious grit to get where I am. I'm proud of that| and what I am now a part of. Good people! I'm also very proud of being a good dad! I had one of the best fathers on the planet| so I have big shoes to fill.Â  So far| it's going pretty good.Who or what is your inspiration in life?The first person that comes to mind is my older son Levi. Levi is an amazing kid. A couple months before he turned two| he was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Simply put| he has some challenges that most kids don't and yet he is the most joy-filled| free-spirited| hard working kid I know. He really is a special human and I get to be his dad. How rad is that! He is all the motivation I need!If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?A picture of my family to remind me why I am playing and why I need to play so hard.A book. Something to feed my mind and something to keep me grounded. Most likely my Bible.A surfboard.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you the most like?I have to say Tony Vlachos. I don't think we are very similar people but I think we agree fundamentally on how you play the game. Tony was a grinder from start to finish. He understands that EVERY piece of the game| EVERY moment| EVERY situation has value and can be used to influence your outcome. I think most players only identify the most obvious parts ofSurvivoras pieces on the board when in reality| every last detail is a movable piece. It's going to be my goal to be ""ON"" all the time in the game. In other words| to never stop playing. I plan to work angles everywhere and with everyone... all the time. I think this is how you win| by paying attention to the details and then playing off of them. Tony did that I think| and so will I.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?My primary goal of being on the show is for the adventure of it! Adventure is something that is important to me| and something I think I will always pursue. But this adventure is a unique opportunity to practice the things I preach to my sons. The show will give me an opportunity to show them that hard work pays off and that pipe dreams are absolutely worth chasing! This show is a special platform to tell a really good story!Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I think I have a lot of skills that serve a team well. I have a strong work ethic| I'm good with my hands| I'm strong and physical| and I think I'm good at making people feel valued. Another thing I am good at is keeping/bringing people together. I think I have the gift of mediation| which will be HUGE inSurvivor! Someone has to keep the alliance glue sticky... I just might be that guy.",38,0

We were polar opposites and did not get along| but in the end| she was proud of me.Who or what is your inspiration in life?My brother Shane. We went into the foster care system after being taken away from our biological mother. Shane wouldn't leave my side and always protected me and made me feel normal. He made sure I wouldn't grow up with negative memories or scars and allowed me to become the person I am today.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?Gum: I have an addiction and I don't just chew| I chomp!Sunglasses: I cannot hide my facial reactions and roll my eyes constantly.Earplugs: I'm an extroverted introvert so the fact that I am surrounded by people and can't get away is going to drive me crazy.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you the most like?Tyson for being a manipulative| mischievous prankster| Ciera for her attitude and foot in the mouth moments| and Michaela for her die-hard competitiveness.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?I love the show and have been obsessed with it since the beginning. I want to be in the depths of the conversations| manipulations| and absolute psychological warfare. Also| the competitions look like so much fun. Oh no| I have to stand in the middle of the blue ocean and prove I'm a badassâGAME ON!Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I will bring my analytical skills. I'm good at going into a situation knowing what I want| reading others| and finding out what drives them| manipulating the situation to make them think my goal is theirs. I have the ability to take the personal side out and bring forth the cutthroat side.",38,0
âLauren O'Connell,"Age:21Hometown:Bakersfield| CaliforniaCurrent residence:Waco| TexasOccupation:Student at Baylor UniversityHobbies:Binge-watching multiple Netflix series at once| sleeping through my alarm| and eating a party-sized Peanut M&Ms bag in one sitting.Pet peeves:People who are intolerant of someone else's personal opinions and beliefs| unnecessary rudeness| and those misguided people who choose Twizzlers over Red Vines.Three words to describe you:Competitive| committed| and compassionate.What is your personal claim to fame?I believe my claim to fame is my resilience and grit. Throughout my physically demanding career as a collegiate athlete on the Baylor Women's soccer team| I've endured four orthopedic surgeries| rehabilitated physically and emotionally in order to remain an integral part of an Elite 8 team| and will obtain a Bachelor's degree in Medical Humanities (in four years!) from a phenomenal university while prioritizing service and volunteerism in the community of Waco.Who or what is your inspiration in life?My parents inspire me. They love passionately: each other| their family| and their friends. They model compassion and selflessness through their daily actions and have taught me to persevere through grief and smile through life's toughest obstacles. They've inspired me to fight for things I believe in and they always remind me that my value is not determined by the perception of others. They love abundantly and without reservation| cheer for others in every circumstance| and model how to reflect Jesus in my life.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?My Bible to remind me that I can only find my worth in Him.Sunscreen. But only SPF 25| because a little tan looks good on everyone.M&Ms.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you the most like?Parvati Shallow is my spirit animal. Her infectious smile| smart wit| and expertise in using her sexuality has won her a place in my heart and I feel like my gameplay could be similar to hers. I also strongly relate to Kelley Wentworth's gameplay. She is unapologetically herself| dominates the physical demands ofSurvivor| and is a threat in any type of challenge. Ideally| I would play the game as a perfect mix of these two powerful females.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?My primary motivation for being on the show is to test my INDIVIDUAL capacity to rise to all the challenges I will face. I have played team sports from the time I was four years old and so have always had teammates to rely on when competition was intense. This game will push me to rely on MYSELF| with no parents or teammates who have my back| nobody to lift me up emotionally| and nobody to help me through the physical demands. It will be a true test of MY strengths| my confidence in my social skills| and my individual ability to build alliances that will benefit me| all in a very short and intense time period. The fierce competition from the starting moment is what draws me to this game. This has always been a dream and goal of mine! I told my family when I was seven years old that I would be onSurvivor| and I FINALLY am!My final motivation is that I will be applying to dental school next year which is an extremely expensive dream| so when I am named Sole Survivor I'll be able to pay for this dream without incurring more debt. As a dentist| I plan to change lives by instilling confidence through beautiful smiles| and winning this game will help me to achieve this without the burden of debilitating debt.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I have a competitive drive that few people can hope to match. I am a fierce athlete with the ability to endure extreme physical battles coupled with the desire to throw myself wholeheartedly into new adventures and challenging situations. ""Surviving"" won't be an issueâI plan to outlast and win. I am brilliantly strategic| but subtly humble about it| so people are not intimidated. In addition| I have a plan for a spectacular social game that cannot be beaten:Â  allowing people to feel like they are in charge| while ensuring them that they are important| loved| and valued| all while I am masterminding moves in the background. I've studied this game for years| my Barbie and Ken doll were named Tina and Colby| and I know exactly how to manipulate if necessary in order to win.",38,0

Okay| I'mdefinitelyneurotic.What is your personal claim to fame?Raising my two kids who impress me every day with their intelligence| strength| humor| and resilience. I hope I can make them as proud of me as I am of them.Who or what is your inspiration in life?My husband. He is incredibly smart| caring| and selfless. He has always been there for me and supports me in everything I do. Every time I watch him with our children| it reminds me that he is the best example of what a parent should be and inspires me to be a better parent myself.If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?My iPhone for its playlist of my favorite songs to keep me motivated when things get tough.A picture of my husband| kids| and two Bernese mountain dogs to remember that they are back home rooting for me.Milk chocolate. That's self-explanatory.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you the most like?A combo of Stephanie for her tenacity| Cirie for her humor and fun-spirit| and Dawn for her propensity to have some emotional moments.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?The challenge. I have wanted to play this insane game since I saw the very first episode. Something about pushing myself to the absolute physical and mental limit possible has always appealed to me. It's about proving to myself and to those that know me that I can actually do this!.Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?There is no doubt that I will be out of my comfort zone every step of the way| but when I set out to do something I become laser focused and I never give up. While I may not be the strongest physical player out there| I am smart| social| and will play the game with both my brain and my heart. I have waited 18 years to do this and nothing is going to stop me from winning. No other outcome is even an option!",38,0

It still amazes me! They had over 3|500 applicants| gave interviews to 140 and awarded only 63. To be a part of that 63 still leaves me in awe and I know it's only by God's grace.Who or what is your inspiration in life?My inspirations are definitely my mom and grandma! Without them there's no way I would be the type of person I am today. They taught me morals| values| and how to always have a loving and caring personality. They've seen me at my lowest times and have never withheld their love for me. We never had much but my mom always made ends meet for me. My grandma was the one who first started me on my walk in faith| which is my biggest rock in life. They are my heroes!If you could have three things on the island| what would they be and why?My Bible because it would be a constant reminder for me that God is always watching over me!My poetry book because my poetry gives me life!My Black Panther jacket because I'm a Marvel fanatic and it can always bring a smile to my face.WhichSurvivorcontestant are you the most like?I relate to Jeremy Collins because that was a family man. He put his family above all else and played solely for them. My family is the only tangible thing I've always had since day one! They're my reason for everything. I also think I'd love to rely more on social gameplay as he did and connect with people for longevity.What's your reason for being onSurvivor?No doubt my primary motivation for being on the show is my family. Since I was born| we've lived in the same trailer without much change. Ever since I was doing well in school| I feel like eyes have been on me to help us out of stagnation. If I can make some things happen to help us go above and beyond| then you can best believe I'm going to be that breakthrough.Survivormay just be that start for me. Secondly| I'm motivated to learn more about myself. I've never had to find my food or stay outside| so I'm ready to see what I can do when tested. And of course| I'm a superfan and this has been a dream of mine! I'm already the youngest black castaway to date.Â  How cool would it be to add being the youngest Sole Survivor onto that?Why do you think you'll ""survive""Survivor?I know I can be the Sole Survivor because I've already been living against the odds. Me being a lower-class black man| I wasn't nurtured to be the salutatorian of his class that would be able to afford Duke University of all places. I didn't have the bloodline of doctors to show me how to succeed or the finances to take prep classes for educational opportunities. I didn't even know what class rank or GPA meant until junior year. When I took the Pre-SAT| I asked ""What class is this for?"" I was set at a disadvantage| yet I made things happen. I went against the grain| and did what I needed to do to put myself on a pre-med track. I'm driven| focused| and possess the willpower to make mountains move. Nothing has stopped me thus far| so no 17 or 19| or however many castaways are going to stop me now!",38,0

Started a fantasy league with my family Season 2 and haven't missed an episode since.Do you still watchSurvivor?Always.Who is your inspiration in life?My parents| Alan and Susie. Also| Jeff Probst.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Everything.Survivorhas been a constant in my life| and kept my family close before| during| and after my time on the show. It may sound silly to some| butSurvivoris far more than just a television show for us. It has given us hope| it has allowed us to dream and realize those dreams| and it brought us joy during the most difficult times in our lives.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?My first ever screen name on the internet was SoleSurvivorAdam.Survivorturned my middle school obsession into a professional title! Ultimately| I believe that I am| at my core| the same person that I was when I playedSurvivorfor the first time. Same values| ambitions| passions| and energy. The difference is that I have more opportunities to realize those ambitions and to make a greater impact on the world around me.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I grew up watching Sandra| Boston Rob| Ethan| Tina| Amber| and Richard Hatch. Playing in Season 40 is like growing up watching Steve Young and Jerry Rice on your favorite football team and then getting to play against them in the Super Bowl. It only can happen in your wildest dreams. So many thousands ofSurvivorsuper-duper fans would do anything to be in my position.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My basic strategy is the same forSurvivoras it is for life: make friends. Anyone who comes into this game believing| ""I'm not here to make friends"" is playing a losing game. What's different this time is that some of the people I will be playing with already are friends. I need to obfuscate my existing relationships| keep an eye out for others doing the same| and work hard to build ""in-game"" trust that goes beyond liking someone outside of the game.This time around| I can't hide how big of a fan I am. I can have fun with that and subtly play into the larger egos| especially since my life is far less serious and scary than it was last time. My sense is I may come into this game generally underestimated| with at least some people believing that my win was fluky and my social game was choppy. I want them to underestimate me and I will play into that| while also recognizing that all of them are incredibly capable and not to be underestimated.",39,0

From working with big organizations that help kids stay healthy| like Grassroot Soccer| to speaking with patients about surviving and thriving in life after a cancer diagnosis.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?My nieces and nephews are going to flip out and have some major bragging rights in the hallways.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?Oh| let me count the ways! In the ""pinball machine"" of life| one thing can change everything about a person's life. Survivor was that one thing. It gave me opportunities that I only dreamed of| I got to see the world| help make small differences in people's lives| got to meet incredible people across the globe| and brought joy and laughter to my family from all the crazy stories I got to tell after each adventure.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?19 years ago I got let go from a job| had a day off in NYC| and sent a VHS audition tape into CBS on a lark the day before it was due.

Sandra Diaz-Twine,"Age:45Previous seasons ofSurvivor:Pearl Islands(winner)|Heroes vs. Villains(winner)|Game ChangersWhat specific accomplishments do you think ultimately earned you the moniker of ""Idol"" when it comes toSurvivor?This is probably the easiest question to answer. I am considered an Idol because I am the only castaway to ever win the game twice and to this day that has never happened again. I won the first season I ever appeared on back in 2003 and also won the second season I ever appeared on back in 2010. I'm not an Idol because I say I'm an Idol| but because my record proves it. Nine years ago and 19 seasons ago I became known as the Queen| and to this day no one has ever come close to tying my record.What do you think you can teach the new castaways to help them become Sole Survivor?I'm an open book when it comes to the seasons I've played in. I plan on sharing all aspects of the game with the castaways. I will be able to discuss situations like being flexible and how to go with the flow when you have no control over what the majority wants to do at a given time. How to build a strong alliance| by trusting people you genuinely like and share common interests with. And that no one is perfect| there's no way to play a perfect game| so when you make a mistake| own it.What part of the game do you think new castaways usually underestimate?The new castaways underestimate how hard the social part of the game truly is. Hard because there's people you will automatically like and people you will automatically dislike. With those you like| you immediately build a bond and trust| yet there can only be one winner. It's easy to vote off people you dislike| but when all those people are gone| now you have to start voting off the ones you consider friends. And these are the friends that you just blindsided and 100 percent of the time are upset that you voted them off and yet you still have to also convince them to give you the million dollar prize. It's really a juggling act.How will being a mentor present a different challenge for you than actually competing in the game?Being a mentor is actually easier than playing the game| because you don't have to focus on the daily aspects ofSurvivor. I know I'm not playing for the million dollars. I know I will not participate in any challenges (hooray). And I know I will never enter the game in some crazy twist. All I have to do is get to know the new players| listen to them carefully| and advise them. In other words| I plan on sharing the knowledge I have gained after playing for 94 consecutive days. I'm going to provide guidance| but at the end of the day each person has to make their own decisions and play their own game.Given that you're not playingSurvivorin the traditional sense| what element of the game are looking forward to NOT having to endure?I'm over the moon knowing I don't have to endure a single challenge the entire season.",39,0
"""Boston"" Rob Mariano","Age:43Previous seasons ofSurvivor:Marquesas|All-Stars|Heroes vs. Villains|Redemption Island(winner)What specific accomplishments do you think ultimately earned you the moniker of ""Idol"" when it comes toSurvivor?I've playedSurvivorfour times over the course of nearly two decades. I have seen the evolution of the game and I am proficient in the three main aspects of the game: the social component| the physical component| and the strategic/psychological component. I wouldn't necessarily call myself an idolâI didn't come up with that ideaâbut I definitely know what I'm doing!What do you think you can teach the new castaways to help them become Sole Survivor?I understand the basics: everything from how to start a fire| build a shelter| and catch fish. And the more complex| social dynamics of the gameâand of course| different strategic approaches.How will being a mentor present a different challenge for you than actually competing in the game?I think the hardest thing about being a mentor for myself is not being able to actually compete.

Heck| it's been 20 years since I played the first time on Season 2. Not only has the game evolved and changed a lot... so have I. I'm no longer just playing for myself. I'm married with four children who will be closely watching and listening to everything I do and every word I speak. I'm 20 years older too. I was the youngest in my Tribe when I playedSurvivor: The Australian Outback. Now| I'm going to be one of the ""older"" people. People see me in a whole new light. Plus| being married to ""Boston Rob"" paints a HUGE target on my back. When I played the first two times| I didn't have that pressure. So| I guess for me I'm going to try to focus on my social game in a big way and try hard to find Idols/advantages! I'd like to think I'll be good at challenges but let's face it| I am not in the shape I was before having four kids. But I also want to focus on enjoying the experience and showing my girls how strong their mom is! I'll never give up and I'll show them to always go big and finish what you start. And in the end| hopefully| win it again!",40,0

He was in a wheelchair and traveling with an infant and his toddlerâand zero support crew. He was smiling. That man blew my mind.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Survivoris my family. My husband competed on Season 29| and I thought he was cute when I saw him on TV. Then we met in real life at a Grassroot Soccer charity soccer tournament hosted by Ethan Zohn| winner ofSurvivor: Africa. And now we have aSurvivorbaby. It's kind of absurd| really.What is one way that playingSurvivorchanged your life?It opened up the competitive beast within| and it also gave me the opportunity to host TV shows| travel around the world as a journalist| and take pics with really excited fans at airports. I played three seasons when I was in my 20s and then processed my experiences for the last decade. I think the main reason that I am able to help people with my work as a life coach and yoga teacher is because I came through such intense experiences playing and winningSurvivorand then afterward with the criticism and reality TV fame. I know what it's like to go after a goal with everything I have. I know in my bones how hard it is to be judged and found lacking. I know the sting of betrayal| and I also know that miracles happen all the time. No matter what it looks like| there is a way through every block.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?I am pumped. I thought I was done| but this opportunity to compete with the best of the best is too good to pass up. The game has changed. It's faster| more complex| and people are bolder. I'm excited to get into this more dynamic arena and win a totally new game.How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?I'm sure I will be targeted again right away| like I was onHeroes vs. Villains. So| this time I will have to take into consideration that I may be on the outside looking in at first. There also may be some people playing with me that I have history withâprobably not good historyâand I will have to clear my mind and see them as totally new| like we're meeting for the first time. I plan to be more aggressive and sneaky in hunting idols| distributing misinformation| letting other people lead and take credit| and really play up that I'm a new mom. I'm definitely not in as good of physical shape as I was the last few times I played| but I have a new stamina and capacity that comes from knowing that I can survive six months of sleep deprivation with a newborn. And| I know that I can connect with people in a completely different way as a mother.,40,0

I'm so grateful for all the fun that has come from being a part ofSurvivor.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My life has changed tremendously in the last seven years. My first go-round I was 28 and newly single| I coveted the escape and the adventure ofSurvivor. Since then| I got married and had three babies as fast as humanly possible. I think this will perhaps change everything about the way I play| I just don't know exactly how. My plan is to take this new season as a completely new and separate experience from the last!,40,0

Every Wednesday.... work| activities| and life in general is planned often around our Wednesday night family viewing!Who is your inspiration in life?This hasn't changed for me and I continue to be inspired by anyone who embraces life with passion. When you see it... you can feel it... and you can't help but be impacted and inspired by it.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Survivoris something that is a shared experience for all of us. We've laughed| we've cried... and we've hooted and hollered at our TV many times over the years. It's the one time where we don't just slow downâwe stop and are all focused 100% on the same thing. It's our time.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?I thinkSurvivorhas changed my life in many ways... but not because of the money. At the core| I remain the person I was before| which until very recently included driving the SAME car| now almost 12 years old| complete with dents and duct tape patching. But playingSurvivorfueled parts of me that were always there| maybe untapped| or maybe pushed me to honor those parts. It's made me more open to life experiences in general| fueled the desire to travel| and now plays a huge part in our family motto of #GoSeeDo (go places we don't normally get to go| see people we don't normally get to see| do things we wouldn't normally do). Ultimately| it was a reminder that life is too short| so suck it up during the crappy parts| and embrace and appreciate the rest.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?It's funny| this answer should be easy... but it's not. Being given the chance to play a second time is huge in and of itself. But for it to be the 40th! EPIC! The game has changed SO much since Season 1 and has brought with it so many incredible players. It feels like a huge honor to be able to be a part of that legacy (even if I was on one of the worst tribes EVER!) so I don't take it lightly.How will you play differently than you did in your past season?My honest answer... I have no clue! LOL! Why?? Because we are who we are| good or bad| and once you're out on that island... all of the best-laid plans| intentions| etc. can quickly dissipate into a miserable mess. So in truth| the core of how I played the first time will remain: adapt| adapt| adapt. And hope that theSurvivor""gods"" are in my favor.",40,0

After winning| it catapulted me to a higher tax bracket| where I consistently stayed since!AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?It's truly as surreal as it was for me the very first time I played. I'm genuinely humbled thatSurvivorlooks at me as one of their top winners| so much that they would invite me back to play again not once| but TWICE! Being a part of this unimaginable milestone of a season is HUGE!How will you play differently than you have in your past seasons?I've playedSurvivortwice (Season 28 and 34)âI won once| and lost once. I've learned that my game-winning performance was similar to that of a one-trick pony. There is no way I can perform the same tricks playing withSurvivorlegends and expect to get away with it. Hence my second time playing onGame Changers. Fortunately for me| I'm well aware that I will have to change the way that I'm wired. I will play this season differently by not being as loud/flashy and will try my best to control the votes/game without making it obvious that I'm doing just that. Wish me luck! LOL!,40,1

I am even considering starting aSurvivorpodcast.Who is your inspiration in life?Sandra| because I want to be the next two-time winner.What doesSurvivormean to you and your family?Survivorhas helped me through hard times. For example| it was a great escape from the stresses of law school. And on a more serious note| I specifically remember when my mom had recently passed away| I was moved by Rodney grieving the loss of his sister on Season 30. I bawled my eyes out. It was a much-needed therapeutic experience.My family has always watchedSurvivorand tried to watch it together when we could. When my dad came to Fiji for the family visit| it was a monumental experience that strengthened our relationship. Because of that moment| we are still closer to this day.What is one way playingSurvivorchanged your life?It made me realize what is important in life. I don't have to focus my career on making money. I can focus my life on my family and my career on helping people.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?It is a dream come true for me to be a part of the 20-year celebration ofSurvivor. Only two years ago| I was daydreaming about how I could ever even get the opportunity to be cast on the show. Now| I am the winner of one ofSurvivor's greatest seasons| and I am placed in the same category as the legends I used to look up to! It is a great honor. I am aSurvivorlegend! How amazing! What a blessing!How will you play differently than in your past season?When I wonDavid vs. Goliath| I never received a single vote against me. I was able to disguise my strategic ability and knowledge of the game under my country accent and chill demeanor. I was able to fly under the radar and build one-on-one relationships with nearly every single player in the game. This time| if I don't receive a single vote the entire game| I will take it as an insult! Everyone has seen how brilliantly I playSurvivor. These legends won't fall for alliance names and my Kentucky charm as easily as a cast of complete strangers did. I won't be able to hide behind bigger threats. So this time| I'm going to be even more aggressive. In short| I am going to have as much fun as possible in the beginning. This is my dream come trueÂ and I want to take it all in. Then| I am going to TURN IT ON. No player will be safe from the Kentucky Nick sneaky ninja assassin blindside! This game is where legends are made!,40,0

In the ""pinball machine"" of life| one thing can change everything about a person's life. Survivor was that one thing. It gave me opportunities that I only dreamed of| I got to see the world| help make small differences in people's lives| got to meet incredible people across the globe| and brought joy and laughter to my family from all the crazy stories I got to tell after each adventure.AsSurvivorapproaches Season 40 and celebrates 20 years on television| what does it mean to be a part of the legacy?19 years ago I got let go from a job| had a day off in NYC| and sent a VHS audition tape into CBS on a lark the day before it was due.
